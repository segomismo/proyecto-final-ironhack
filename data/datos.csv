,,,,,,"Photos by @richardbarnes | Since 2019 I've been photographing for a National Geographic story on the repatriation of objects from European and North American museums to the countries that originally created them. For many years now I've been involved in photography in and around museum collections across the globe. I'm interested in how nations or peoples define themselves through their collections and how those collections were obtained, curated, and put on display.

Colonial powers acquired (some would say stole) sacred objects and historical artifacts from African nations as well as from North American Indian tribes for the better part of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Recently, curators, museum directors, politicians, and others have advocated a return of these objects to their ""rightful"" owners, primarily in African nations. I've photographed in Cameroon, Nigeria, Benin, and Kenya, as well as in numerous European and North American museums where these objects have been housed for decades. It's a complex and nuanced story: In many instances it's unclear if the objects that ended up in European and American museums were legally obtained, ""gifted,"" or stolen. In some cases—as with the thousands of Benin Bronzes, which were looted by the British in a punitive raid of 1897—it's clear, but in others it's open to interpretation and not so definitive as to how the objects found their way into European and North American collections.

This animal, with an estimated wild population of only a thousand, lost one of its hind legs after getting caught in a wolf trap placed by mountain shepherds trying to protect their herds.

Despite the IUCN’s recommendation that the leopard be relocated to a larger facility in Europe as part of a breeding program, the government has deemed it the property of Iraq, and the animal has been unable to receive the resources it needs for full rehabilitation. The leopard’s growl of distress speaks volumes—a heartbreaking reminder of the consequences of human intervention and the urgent need to protect the dwindling population of threatened species.

Among them are the Kurdish Iraqi college students I photographed in 2015 in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq; they wouldn’t quit playing basketball despite war raging all around them. With the Islamic State attacking and seizing large swaths of land in Iraq, people were fleeing for their lives. It was a dangerous time for women—especially for Christians, Yazidis, and Kurds—who were frequently kidnapped and killed by insurgents. The young women who attended the American University of Iraq in Sulaymaniyah not only kept going to school, but they also refused to give up the sport. Many of them are now in their 30s and have children of their own. It was heartening to spend time with them nearly a decade ago, on and off the court, as they figured out who they wanted to be and what they stood for.

China is also the world’s largest consumer of coal and such dependence has its costs, namely the environmental impacts of rising greenhouse gas emissions. In September 2020, President Xi Jinping announced that China would become carbon neutral by 2060. Smaller mines were shut down and others consolidated into fewer but larger power companies, all with an eye toward shifting to wind- and solar-powered electricity. But change is hard. Because of a power crunch, China has had to ramp up coal production and, according to a recent report by the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air and the Global Energy Monitor, has approved construction permits for new power plants at the rate of two a week in 2022. #coalmines #energy",65.696 Me gusta,2023-03-08T03:30:14.000Z,https://scontent-mad2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/334429059_227497436343021_8396981269642871089_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-mad2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=JwKDRL7bJd0AX-Xu0NM&edm=ABmJApABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzA1MzY3Mjk2MjY2MjI5Mzg0Mg%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfBoSSWiDHtI8U9czRHRqPUsc9iDLy5kGbxB75RcCBXMxA&oe=64169160&_nc_sid=6136e7,imagenpreuba28-1.jpg,"Photo by National Geographic on March 07, 2023.

I saw so much devastation in the young eyes of these beautiful souls. I had never witnessed such love for a nation or land. A 10- year-old wrote a poem, a 15-year-old made a collage, and a 7-year-old created a photo essay, all focused on the loss of their beloved Syria, a place now further traumatized and forgotten.

,,,,,,"Photos by @renaeffendiphoto | Wedged among the Mediterranean Sea, Syria, and Israel, Lebanon has seen a brutal collapse of its vibrant liberal haven in the Middle East. The country’s deterioration has been rapid and painful. A severe economic crisis in 2019 caused more than half the population of a once middle-income nation to plunge into poverty within the span of a year or so. The arrival of COVID-19 worsened already desperate conditions. The Lebanese are a study in resilience but also of multigenerational trauma. In the March issue, an essay from Lebanese writer Rania Abouzeid examines the country’s breakdown and how the 2020 Beirut port explosion was its gravest manifestation. From the rich and aristocratic to the low income, all Lebanese are grappling with a confluence of crises—financial, security, and political.

(1) A group of women explores a fort known as the Sea Castle, built in the 13th century by the Crusaders, on the coastline of Sidon, Lebanon’s third largest city. Archaeological sites are found all along the ancient land’s shore.

(2) On August 4, 2020, an explosion at a Port of Beirut warehouse storing ammonium nitrate killed at least 218 people, injured thousands, and destroyed more than 85,000 properties. These grain silos absorbed some of the blast’s impact, shielding part of the capital from widespread damage.

(3) Ralph Mellehe’s family weeps over his coffin. Mellehe was part of a 10-person firefighting team dispatched to put out the blaze.

(4) In Batroun, modern restaurants and clubs exist alongside ancient ruins and historic churches.

(5) Hady Fowal, 12, joined a group of men who set up a roadblock of burning tires in March 2021 on the main highway to Tripoli as a protest of Lebanon’s deteriorating economic conditions.

(6) Lebanese relax in seawater pools at a beach resort in Chekka on the northern coast in September 2019. A month later, the nation’s economy crumbled.

The portraits were taken at the Gathering of Nations, the largest powwow in North America. This is Jessica R. Bojorquez of California's La Jolla Band of Luiseño Indians:

“I learned later on in life that I was Native. My parents didn’t tell us, because back in the day—my grandparents’ generation—it was even worse to be Native than it was to be Black in Southern California. Natives weren't allowed in town; we had bounties on our heads. A lot of Natives transferred over to the Spanish side [Mexico]. They went across the border and portrayed themselves as Mexicans—that way they could go into town and buy things and not be killed, in other words.""

Today Kurdish cities are the beating heart of protests against the Islamic Republic of Iran and its brutal treatment toward unarmed protesters. The uprising was triggered last September by the death of Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish woman who died in police custody. Protesters have embraced the slogan “Woman, Life, Freedom,” which has roots in female militias fighting against ISIS. Kurds are an ethnic group whose culture is thousands of years old; their influence can be found in Persian music, language, and traditions. They are native to the Zagros Mountains, which span Iran, Iraq, and Turkey.

Akkök plays the flute for his beloved animals in his living room, a place of solace and comfort for the 70+ strays he has welcomed and rescued on his farm just south of Istanbul. He joined a growing number of city dwellers moving to the countryside, where he cares for his four-legged friends. His blind horse, Reyhan, is drawn to the mellow sounds of the music and has even damaged his saxophone in her enthusiasm.

Through it all, Akkök's door remains open, providing his furry family with a safe haven. “We enjoy each other's company,” he says. “They're like my kids now, and I would only give them to decent and good people who can take very good care of them.”

Although the species is common in some areas, there is little data about it. A recent study that called the frog ""an underexplored source of bioactive peptides"" found three new antimicrobial peptide families in the skin secretions of the frog—a reminder that we must protect its habitat. As we bring many animals to extinction, we are destroying opportunities to find cures for diseases such as cancer and to discover new antibiotics for multiresistant bacteria among other substances.
