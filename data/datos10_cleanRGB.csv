Having survived historical events that greatly reduced population size, cheetahs today have low genetic variability, which puts them at risk of disease and harmful mutations.

Here is Kiliii working around the plane that crashed in the shallow lagoon of Koror. Throughout those passing decades, marine life gradually flourish onto the plane that provides a substrate for them to grow onto. Corals and sponges encrust the eroded airframe, while reef fishes take shelter in the shadowy cockpit. Nowadays, Palau is world-renowned for its pristine marine environment and abundance of sharks that attract divers from all over the world, but the small nation of Micronesia was also a major battleground of the Pacific Theater, namely the Battle of Peleliu.

Not exactly a three hour tour!!!

We’re slowly coming back to normal life as we depart the Falkland Islands after an unforgettable voyage to the remote, mysterious South Sandwich Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean.

It all began earlier this year, when Dr. Emma Nicholson decided to answer the siren call of Mt. Michael, a ~ 900 meter unclimbed volcano located on a tiny speck of ash and rock known as Saunders Island. For more than twenty years, volcanologists have speculated about the strange thermal anomaly visible in satellite imagery that seems to emanate from within Michael’s crater. The heat signature, which at times has indicated surface temperatures of more than 1000 degrees C, was suggestive of molten lava close to the Earth’s surface — perhaps even one of nature’s rarest phenomena and volcanologists’ most valuable natural laboratory, an active lava lake. But because the volcanic gases constantly exiting the crater mix with the region’s infamous weather conditions to create a witch’s brew of sulfur dioxide plume, cloud, and storm — getting a clear-eyed look into the crater is virtually impossible from space. And, thanks to Saunders Island’s location, directly downwind of the Drake Passage at 57 degrees south and 1300 nm from the closest port, getting there the old fashioned way is a wee-bit inconvenient.

You might say Emma’s dream was to explore this uncharted volcano, maybe even “discover” a lava lake. But she (like all good field scientists) prefers another term: ground-truthing.

What Emma didn’t immediately reveal is that more people have been to the moon than had set foot on Saunders Island… and now we know why. Stay-tuned for the #LavaSandwichExpedition

We came to work in Palau, one of the world’s smallest countries in the western Pacific renowned for its pristine marine environment while the spirit of conservation lies deep in traditional culture. This island nation of Micronesia spearheaded a major movement to address thee global declines of shark populations by establishing the first shark sanctuary in the world in 2009, where commercial shark fishing are banned throughout the whole exclusive economic zone of its waters. It is no wonder why Palau is a major attraction to divers from around the world, enjoying economic benefits of healthy shark populations with shark diving tourism accounts for about 8% of the GDP, while a single grey reef shark is estimated to generate close to 2 million USD throughout its lifetime. Here is a shiver of Blacktip reef sharks in the shallow of “Shark City” of Rock Islands Southern Lagoon, a UNESCO world heritage site. These small reef sharks frequent this area as visitors often throw out their lunch, becoming an attraction of the Rock Islands. Not that we are encouraging feeding wild animals, but the sharks have accustomed to people and check us out even without feeding involved. This is only a small part of the story that @Kiliiiyuyan is working on but he definitely enjoyed working with the sharks here as we made a few visits to this area.

We came to work in Palau, one of the world’s smallest countries in the western Pacific renowned for its pristine marine environment while the spirit of conservation lies deep in traditional culture. This island nation of Micronesia spearheaded a major movement to address thee global declines of shark populations by establishing the first shark sanctuary in the world in 2009, where commercial shark fishing are banned throughout the whole exclusive economic zone of its waters. It is no wonder why Palau is a major attraction to divers from around the world, enjoying economic benefits of healthy shark populations with shark diving tourism accounts for about 8% of the GDP, while a single grey reef shark is estimated to generate close to 2 million USD throughout its lifetime. Here is a shiver of Blacktip reef sharks in the shallow of “Shark City” of Rock Islands Southern Lagoon, a UNESCO world heritage site. These small reef sharks frequent this area as visitors often throw out their lunch, becoming an attraction of the Rock Islands. Not that we are encouraging feeding wild animals, but the sharks have accustomed to people and check us out even without feeding involved. This is only a small part of the story that @Kiliiiyuyan is working on but he definitely enjoyed working with the sharks here as we made a few visits to this area. Follow @kiliiiyuyan for the update of his current project and stories on indigenous culture and @shinalodon for other stuffs mostly about marine conservation.

The mosque was constructed in 1515, and its charm has remained unchanged since that time.

It was, however, a victim of its own success, and eventually went extinct 2000 years ago. It is the first species ever to go extinct as a result of human appetite.

Since the 1980s Mahmut Miski, Professor of Pharmacognosy at the University of Istanbul, has been investigating a plant - ferula drudeana - which he believes to be Silphion. A precious few flowering plants are growing on the side of a volcano in Turkey. Here, he cups his hands around some of the plant’s flowering ends.

All told we sailed 5,877 nautical miles from southern Maine to Alaska over 112 days. Thanks to all of you who followed along. Knowing you were out there pulling for us meant everything to our crew !

I can say that as the skipper of a boat that has spent over 100 days in these waters, what you think about when passing through the Bering Strait is not a feeling of accomplishment or triumph. The thoughts going through my mind revolved around the foul current, the sea state, wind direction, and whether I could make port before the next southerly gale.

In 2018, two months before the first anniversary of the storm, my father died by suicide. Since then, I’ve been looking to document the stories and voices of those who also lost loved ones in the wake of the storm. At the beginning of the year, I pitched this story to @natgeo and was able to connect with four families with diverse losses. In our meetings we talked, looked at treasured possessions of their loved ones, and were able to sustain each other in reliving the painful memories that talking about Puerto Rico’s worst natural disaster in modern history brings to light.

Currently, a few days before the 5th anniversary of the storm, Puerto Rico has been impacted by Hurricane Fiona, a category 1 storm, causing an island wide blackout and massive floods.",3653,2022-09-20,https://scontent-mad2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/307540800_5296010087193658_6865460116793399502_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-mad2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=TaCdwGNLALYAX8ifI0z&edm=ABmJApABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MjkzMTA5Mzc3ODA1MzA4NzY3NA%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfDeRecm52n1VZDVls87YN3zjo5NohRD2yg83hNeTsCQxw&oe=6417BC74&_nc_sid=6136e7,imagenpreubaJ32-4.jpg,"Photo by Nat Geo in the Field on September 19, 2022.",32,0,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Listening to their conversations, many of them were imaginary stories that were created and understood only by them. They enjoyed those conversations very much. Despite their severe dementia, they are still happily married. However, it is dangerous for people with dementia to live by themselves as they often don’t grasp the consequences of their actions.

#TheArcticMystery expedition update

Almost immediately after Taya and Polar Sun
escaped from Pasley Bay, I saw through the binoculars that there was a wall of ice a few miles off to our south. The latest ice chart showed ice extending west from the coast of the Gulf of Boothia and another penis-shaped piece of 7/10th ice extending east from King William (photo 2). You didn't need to be an ice forecaster to see that the two pieces were about to join. For all we knew, this had already happened. One of the toughest things about doing the NW is the lag between what you see on the ice charts and what is there when you arrive at said location in real life.

The AIS showed a French boat passing to our west. They had just come through James Ross Strait and they reported it was still open and gave me a waypoint to aim for. There was also a Dutch boat heading south about 18 miles ahead of us. By plotting their location via their AIS signal I was able to draw an imaginary line for the location of the ice.

By nightfall, we had passed three more sections of ice. It wasn't until we were well south of Matty Island the next morning though, that I let myself believe we had finally put the crux of the Northwest Passage behind us.

A lot has happened since, but for now l'Il just say that Polar Sun is in Cambridge Bay, and @zartman_rigging, @rudy.le and I are investigating whether it might be possible to haul out here for the winter. The crew needs to get home and there is real concern that we lost too much time to make it up and over Point Barrow and through the Bering Strait before the fall storm cycles begin. The decision as to whether we should end this year's voyage here has been one of the toughest I've ever made.

Earlier this morning we hiked to the other side of the bay to look at some steel cradles that previous voyagers have used to haul out here for the winter. There is no boat yard here in Cambridge. If you want to get your boat out of the water in this part of the world, good luck figuring it out.

#TheArcticMystery Expedition update cont.

Taya was rafted up next to us. They had come in the night before, approaching with the sound of metal crunching against rock as they motored over a shoal to reach the safe haven of ""Ice Boulder Bay."" It was a good thing they did. By morning their little sliver of open water was gone.

The wind had finally died and the sun was shining, so I decided to go ashore to stretch my legs and hopefully clear my head. The dinghy made a tinkling sound as it cut through the skim of ice that now covered the open water. When I got back to the boat in the afternoon, chunks of ice were breaking apart all around us sending mini tsunamis through the bay. The ice boulder itself, which had been our safe haven for a day and a half, now appeared ready to topple and possibly crush the boats. There was nowhere to go. But we couldn't stay where we were.

Taya set off first and Polar Sun followed. At first, we were only looking for a new spot to tie up. But after muscling past two huge flows, which entailed ramming them numerous times with the bow of the boat, it became clear that we had to go all out to free ourselves from Pasley Bay. A light west wind was suddenly creating small leads along the shore that seemed to appear just when we needed them. Where there had been a glacial wall of ice the night before, we found an opening. And then another. And another.

At one point, Polar Sun was so close to land I could have almost jumped off onto the beach. Taya, which only draws three feet, was in front, radioing back soundings. Two meters, said Alan. Polar Sun draws six feet - when she's not massively overloaded. I throttled up. If we hit the bottom, we'd somehow just have to power through.

As we neared Point Edward, the leads got bigger. Renan was up on the spreaders calling directions. Polar Sun took the lead. An hour later, Polar Sun and Taya were in open water.
But the ice was not done with us yet. According to the most recent ice chart, it was closing back up.

Through the binoculars, I saw another wall of ice ahead.

#TheArcticMystery expedition update

In the two and a half weeks since my last post, Polar Sun has been navigating the crux of the Northwest Passage. At first, we made good progress, heading north from Pond Inlet up Navy Board Inlet, then west down Lancaster Sound to Beechey Island, where the Franklin expedition spent the winter of 1845-46. After a few scrapes with ice in Barrow Strait, we found ourselves flying south down Peel Sound between Somerset Island and Prince of Wales Island. Little did we know at the time that we were about 24 hours too late. The day before, our Swiss friend Draco had slipped through some 5/10th ice in James Ross Strait. But now a storm was brewing and the window was closing. We needed to find shelter, so we tucked into a place called Pasley Bay. It was a decision we would live to bitterlv regret.

This is what it looks like when you are trapped by ice in the Northwest Passage. Every day for ten days, the ice situation got a little worse, and we found ourselves battling around the clock to keep Polar Sun from being crushed or run aground by the ice During one particularly dicey maneuver, the bow went up onto a floe and when it slid off, the wind grabbed the boat and turned it 180 degrees. We found ourselves facing the wrong way, surrounded by ice, in dangerously shallow water. According to the depth sounder, we were on the bottom. On Friday, August 26th, I awoke to find that the ice had filled in the last sliver of open water. Luckily, we had tied to a small grounded ice berg which had prevented us from being pushed onto shore by slabs of ice that were six feet thick. The temperature was well below freezing and a thin sheen of ice covered the open water between the floes. ""Winter is coming,"" said Jacob. I didn't reply, but in my head I was thinking, 'Holy shit. I can't believe we are actually getting frozen in for the winter, just like Franklin.

The temperature was well below freezing and a thin sheen of ice covered the open water between the floes. ""Winter is coming,"" said Jacob. I didn't reply, but in my head I was thinking, 'Holy shit. I can't believe we are actually getting frozen in for the winter, just like Franklin.

#TheArcticMystery expedition update

In the two and a half weeks since my last post, Polar Sun has been navigating the crux of the Northwest Passage. At first, we made good progress, heading north from Pond Inlet up Navy Board Inlet, then west down Lancaster Sound to Beechey Island, where the Franklin expedition spent the winter of 1845-46. After a few scrapes with ice in Barrow Strait, we found ourselves flying south down Peel Sound between Somerset Island and Prince of Wales Island. Little did we know at the time that we were about 24 hours too late. The day before, our Swiss friend Draco had slipped through some 5/10th ice in James Ross Strait. But now a storm was brewing and the window was closing. We needed to find shelter, so we tucked into a place called Pasley Bay. It was a decision we would live to bitterlv regret.

This is what it looks like when you are trapped by ice in the Northwest Passage. Every day for ten days, the ice situation got a little worse, and we found ourselves battling around the clock to keep Polar Sun from being crushed or run aground by the ice During one particularly dicey maneuver, the bow went up onto a floe and when it slid off, the wind grabbed the boat and turned it 180 degrees. We found ourselves facing the wrong way, surrounded by ice, in dangerously shallow water. According to the depth sounder, we were on the bottom. On Friday, August 26th, I awoke to find that the ice had filled in the last sliver of open water. Luckily, we had tied to a small grounded ice berg which had prevented us from being pushed onto shore by slabs of ice that were six feet thick.

My dream of sailing to Baffin Island was realized yesterday around 2am when we tied Polar Sun up to the brand new public wharf in Pond Inlet after a six day 680-mile crossing of Baffin Bay. I don’t think it’s possible to describe, at least not in a few words, how good it felt (not only to find that there’s now a dock in Pond) to close the loop on a dream I’ve been nurturing since I was 26, hanging on the side of Polar Sun Spire, looking out over Sam Ford Fjord and imagining how cool it would be to visit this magnificent place in a small boat during open water.

The plan had been to pull into Sam Ford Fjord and sail beneath Polar Sun Spire, but the breakup of the ice in that area is at least two weeks late, and unfortunately we had to pass it by. Sadly, this also meant that we weren’t able to pick up our friends @sarahmcnairlandry and @erikboomer, who have been climbing and kayaking in the area for the past several weeks. (They are now executing their backup plan and hiking overland back to Clyde River.)

When we finally made it up and over the middle pack, which you can see in photos 2 and 3, we got hit with a 20 knot headwind that stayed on us for the rest of the passage. Close hauled, we sailed in and out of fog banks in heavy chop, sometimes with extensive amounts of ice in the water. It was definitely a character building experience.

When the sheer-sided mountains lining the entrance to the Buchan Gulf materialized out of the gloom on day six, a hearty cheer, heard by no one besides us, rang through the cold clear air. That night, we battled our way through ten miles of pack ice to a tenuous anchorage in the lee of Cape Antrobus on Nova Zembla Island. The next morning, Polar Sun was visited by a pod of belugas, which seemed to pay no heed to the strange boat from Maine.

We have one more day here in Pond to catch up on our correspondence and get Polar Sun ready for the trials ahead. There is still a lot of ice ahead of us in the Northwest Passage, so we will take it one day at a time.

The citizens of Iceland are no stranger to volcanic activity. The country is located between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates, which make it a hot spot for eruptions when the plates move apart.

Those of you who have been following #TheArcticMystery expedition may have noticed we dropped off the radar in mid July.

For a number of reasons, we’d like to hold back the bulk of the details about where we’ve been and the experience we’ve just had. The short version is that we spent the past two weeks in the western Arctic trying to figure out what happened to Franklin and his men on their ill fated expedition to the Northwest Passage in 1845.

With Polar Sun in the capable hands of Ben Zartmann @zartman_rigging, we flew from Ilulissat, Greenland to King William Island in Nunavut. There we met up with inveterate Franklin searcher Tom Gross and a small team including Gjoa Haven local Inuit guide Jacob Keanik. Over the next 12 days we covered nearly 500 miles on four wheelers, through some of the most rugged, remote and inaccessible terrain I’ve ever had the pleasure to explore.

King William Island’s 5,000-square miles, no point of which rises higher than 300 feet above sea level, is dotted with a maze of lakes, streams, rivers, mud bogs—and mile upon mile of bleached ridges of razor sharp limestone shingle that ate the tires of our four wheelers for breakfast.

As we followed the sad trail of Franklin’s men on their doomed march out of the most savage wilderness on Earth, we observed musk ox, caribou, foxes and endless waterfowl as they went about their daily lives, exactly as they have for thousands of years. And we walked away deeply humbled and with our imaginations and hearts filled to overflowing after one of the richest experiences of our lives.

We’re now reunited with Ben back on Polar Sun in Ilulissat, a bit worse for the wear, but excited to get back underway. Polar Sun is topped off with food, fuel and water, the rig is tuned, and the ice has broken up enough in Baffin Bay to warrant our next move, which is to begin sailing west across Baffin Bay toward the Northwest Passage.

Thanks to everyone who has supported us thus far. It is nice to know that so many of you appreciate what we are trying to do.

I found Sahibjit by chance. While I was walking along the road that divides two neighbouring villages in India’s Punjab along the India Pakistan border, I saw pink and blue lights on the horizon. I had to find the source!

Sahibjit, 23, is a farmer attending to an ailing father in India’s Punjab along the India-Pakistan border. His struggles are aggregated by the lack of access to health facilities for which he will have to travel for at least 25kms to get his father the attention he needs.

Parkash Kaur has seen 85 years of life. She lives in India’s Punjab along the India-Pakistan border. Dadi (grandma) has seen a country divide and witnessed the turmoil, gotten married at an early age, given birth to 2 sons, seen villages being flooded and people resettle and rebuild their lives, and seen her grandsons get married and have kids. Now she spends most of her time sitting on a cot at her home, staring away into some place in the distance with her limited vision, and lying down when she gets tired of doing this.

And when she sees a visitor, which is often, because people here in the village live a community life, she greets them with a smile and asks them for tea. Like she did with us. Always grateful for such heart warming encounters.

Stanton Drew probably looks much as it did thousands of years ago, and unlike at Stonehenge, there was a very real feeling of solitude here.

The Great Circle, shown here in the first image, is one of the largest stone circles in Britain. In contrast to Stonehenge and Avebury, the stone circles here receive very little tourist attention.
Stanton Drew probably looks much as it did thousands of years ago, and unlike at Stonehenge, there was a very real feeling of solitude here.

Yesterday was a long, eventful day for the crew of Polar Sun. Two nights earlier we were swapping stories about running aground with some Dutch sailors who rafted up with us in Sisimiut. I knocked on wood at the time, but considering how poorly charted the waters are here in Greenland I should have known better. One huge difference between the Arctic and our home waters in New England is how much of the area in which we are cruising is uncharted or unsurveyed. Our Forward Looking Sonar (FLS) has been instrumental in keeping us off the bottom - until yesterday. The chart showed feet in this little tickle, but it was actually more like 3. I saw a 2.4 on the depth sounder, which I was expecting. When it suddenly went to 1.4 I threw the boat into reverse. But it was too late

Fortunately we didn't hit too hard as the bottom was thickly covered in kelp. But we did end up hard aground. We tried to kedge off with a stern anchor that we dropped 300 feet astern with our trusty dinghy, but the bottom was so foul that we couldn't get the Fortress anchor to set. It was low tide, so we had no choice but to sit and wait. An hour and a half later, with the help of our ice poles and some serious RPMs in reverse, we got free. There was talk of trying to still push through the tickle but we opted to back track with our tail
between our legs.

As I write this post, #TheArcticMystery expedition is pushing north up the west coast of Greenland aboard my 47’ sailboat, Polar Sun. A little over a month ago, we set off from southern Maine with the goal of solving one of the greatest mysteries in Arctic history: what really happened to the Franklin expedition, which disappeared in the Northwest Passage in the late 1840s.
Dozens of worthy expeditions have preceded us with a similar goal, but we have new research that we hope will lead us to Sir John Franklin’s tomb on King William Island.

Soon, we will join Franklin’s route in Disko Bay, and from there, if the ice allows, we’ll attempt to follow in the wakes of the Erebus and the Terror into the Arctic Archipelago in which they vanished more than 150 years ago.

@renanozturk and I have been on some epic expeditions for @natgeo in the past, but I think #TheArcticMystery is our most ambitious assignment yet. Our voyage, as we have laid it out, covers more than 7,000 nautical miles and will span at least three and a half months. But the most daunting aspect of this enterprise is not the storm we faced in the Davis Strait or the prospect of being caught in the ice like Franklin — but rather, the time spent away from our loved ones. To help achieve at least a semblance of balance between our work and personal lives, we’ve brought aboard our wives @hamptonkew and @taylorfreesolo, and my six year old son Tommy, for the Greenland section of our voyage.

A few weeks together won’t make our time apart any easier, but the sparkle in Tommy’s eye as we stood atop the Sermilinguaq Glacier gave me hope that the spirit of adventure was stirring inside of him — like it does inside all of us who seek the high and wild places of this world.",9745,2022-07-07,https://scontent-mad2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/292430259_590187659449156_60459537302119895_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-mad2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=oM5jFzHVFtgAX_p1Xn0&edm=ABmJApABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=Mjg3NzI5MjA5NjYwNTg1MDczMQ%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfA4DO6KA5oJdtDQVXoXMaaeozHVd4oY4El1ReAjrHgVzw&oe=64189F1B&_nc_sid=6136e7,imagenpreubaJ75-1.jpg,"Photo shared by Nat Geo in the Field on July 07, 2022 tagging @renan_ozturk, @m_synnott, and @expedition.studios.",75,18,"['#TheArcticMystery', '#TheArcticMystery']",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Her passion for storytelling came from growing up in a house full of books and reflecting on how she wasn’t always able to find herself in those books. Because of that, Nabongo says, “When I travel, it’s important for me to tell the stories that we rarely hear” and bring more representation to the Black community. “We never see beautiful images of places where there is war, as if beauty and war can’t coexist. That’s why storytelling is so important to me. It’s about decentering myself and using my platform to tell stories of other people throughout the world.”

While he’s always had a love of cooking, Cason’s passion for barbecue took off after he came across barbecue cook-off shows. Inspired, he saved up money to buy his first barbecue trailer and eventually competed for the first time in 2006. Since then, Cason has competed in close to 400 competitions, along the way diversifying and perfecting his techniques to become the well-rounded, internationally known pitmaster he is today. His self-made success has taken him around the world to compete, teach, and bring the joy of barbecue to people of many cultures and backgrounds. He’s been featured on shows such as “BBQ Pitmasters,” “BBQ Pit Wars,” “The Kitchen,” and “Chopped,” and his own upcoming show, “World of Flavor With Big Moe Cason,” premieres July 25.

Cason says that barbecue plays an important role within Black culture and the Black community. He personally believes that “barbecue as we celebrate it today came from humble beginnings, the early slaves taking their homeland techniques and spices to create something, out of pure necessity, for their families.” To see where barbecue is today on a global level, Cason can’t help but feel humbled and thankful for those origins.

I didn’t want to say anything until we were officially underway—for fear of jinxing what I hope will be the trip of a lifetime—but since we just left the dock at Rumery’s Boat Yard in Biddeford, Maine, I think it’s time to say a few words about the voyage which has just begun.

In some respects our goal is straight forward: to sail Polar Sun, my Stevens 47, from Maine to Alaska via the Northwest Passage. But @Renan_ozturk and I are also on assignment for @natgeo to tell a story about the Franklin expedition, which disappeared in the Northwest Passage in the late 1840s.

There is a lot that has gone into getting us to this point, and I will try to fill in some gaps along the way, but for now we are heading into the Gulf of Maine en route to the Davis straight and eventually Nuuk Greenland around July 1st.

For anyone who might be interested in following our progress stayed tuned for the next 4 months @renan_ozturk @m_synnott

Once a week for 2 hours, Ikuko's trainer visits her to help her do several exercises to include stretching, weight training, and running. ""Even if I am very busy and tired, I never skip this exercise,"" Ikuko told me. A Geisha's work is physically demanding as they perform while dressed in a kimono, wear a 2-kilo wig for several hours, serve drinks, dance, and ensure customers enjoy their time.

There were more than 400 geishas in Akasaka area in Tokyo when she started; nowadays, only 20 remain.

As a member of the weasel family (Mustelidae), sea otters lack fat storage and must rely on their fur (the densest in the animal kingdom) and a fast metabolism. To feed their metabolism sea otters must eat up to 30% of their body weight a day.

Like other weasels, sea otters are quite smart and can be rather mischievous. Still moments are rare. Catching the reflection of his own self on the dome of my underwater housing, this youngster paused for a moment before carrying on with his daily duties.

""Crescere Nel Bosco"" is a school in nature located in Velletri in the heart of the Castelli Romani Regional Park, near Rome, Italy.
The project hosts about 40 children in kindergarten and about thirty in primary school: the dialogue with the state and “traditional” school in the area is constant and effective.
In the outdoors, children have more incentive to be together, to be in a group, to move around in company, to get out of the shell of the Internet and the shelter of the house.
""Growing in the Woods” is a documentation project focused on the most important experiences of education in nature in Italy. Supported by @InsideNatGeo’s Emergency Fund for Journalists.

This area is also home to some of the last intact coastal temperate rainforests on southern Vancouver Island, the vast majority of which have been clear-cut. The nearby intact watershed of Fairy Creek has sparked protests and blockades in response to the proposed clear-cutting within that neighboring watershed. These protests and blockades, which began in August 2020, have been ongoing for over a year. They have widened to include multiple blockades of other intact forests in the region, recently overtaking the 1993 Clayoquot Sound clear-cutting protests as the largest civil disobedience campaign in Canadian history.

The aspen dieback, as it's called, was brought about by prolonged drought as a result of climate change, which in turn made these aspen forests susceptible to insect infestation and other threats. Aspen become increasingly unhealthy, eventually dying and falling. Tent caterpillars are thought to be a major cause of aspen dieback, but research still is in the early stages and much is unknown.
The problem is compounded by the fact that the boreal forest is the world’s greatest terrestrial carbon sink as well as one its most concentrated, one of our greatest allies in the fight against climate change and global warming. However, as these aspen forests die and decompose, they release massive stored carbon into the atmosphere, further fueling climate change and the conditions that cause aspen dieback.

A wooden panel welcomes visitors to the preschool:
""In this little piece of the world it is not forbidden: to play ball / to get dirty / to jump on hay bales / to play with water / to climb trees / to scream with joy / to laugh out loud / to go in puddles.”
“Asilo Nel Bosco of Ostia” is an Italian association that works on educational projects for children from two to 14 years old, where all the activities take place outdoors, in contact with nature.
Over the course of this year, I have documented several entities committed to outdoor education in my country. The pandemic has definitely challenged the school system and highlighted the need for a rethink.
This project was born from interest as a photojournalist but also as a reaction to the difficult and tragic year that shook my country. As a man and as a father, I sought a rapprochement with nature. And I've also done that through photography. Spending a lot of time with these children has been a joy and a way to reconnect with my childhood.
""Growing in the Woods” is a documentation project focused on the most important experiences of education in nature in Italy. Supported by @InsideNatGeo’s Emergency Fund for Journalists.

The dead and dying aspen can be differentiated from the few healthy aspen in this frame by their lack of leaves.
Prolonged drought as a result of climate change has made these aspen forests susceptible to many pests and other threats. All across boreal forests, the largest forest ecosystem on earth, increasingly large numbers of aspen are being decimated by Aspen Dieback. As aspen become increasingly unhealthy they lose their leaves, eventually die, and then fall to the forest floor and decompose.
This compounds the problem of climate change and Aspen Dieback as boreal forests and wetlands are the world’s greatest carbon sink. An acre of boreal forest is almost twice as effective at storing carbon as an acre of tropical rainforest and as a result they are one of our most effective and powerful allies in the fight against climate change. However as these aspen forests die and decompose they release their tremendous stores of carbon back into the atmosphere creating a vicious cycle by further fuelling climate change and the conditions that will likely result in even more extensive Aspen Dieback in the future.

Surrounded by a sea of clearcuts, Big Lonely Doug is a large Coastal Douglas Fir tree located in the Gordon River Valley of Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. With a height of 70.2 meters or 230 feet, a circumference of 11.91 meters or 39 feet, and a diameter of 3.91 meters or 12.4 feet it is the second largest Douglas Fir in Canada after the Red Creek Fir in the nearby San Juan Valley. This area is also home to some of the last intact coastal temperate rainforests on southern Vancouver Island, the vast majority of which have been clearcut logged. The nearby intact watershed of Fairy Creek has sparked protests and blockades in response to the proposed clearcutting within that neighbouring watershed. These protests and blockades which began at the end of August 2020 have been ongoing for over a year at the time of this writing. They have widened to include multiple blockades of other intact forests in the region and have now totalled approximately 1000 people arrested, recently overtaking the 1993 Clayoquot Sound protests as the largest civil disobedience campaign in Canadian history.

Next time on the road, specially from Spring to Autumn when snakes are active, drive carefully to avoid running over any animal.

Mothers have just six short months (roughly) to get her pup ready for the world. In this time the pup must learn how to properly groom itself, find food and learn to avoid predators. During these hard six months, mothers will be pushed to the limits in order to provide the nutrients that both her and her newborn need. You can often find mothers and their young away from large groups where they can get some much needed rest.

As this pup fell deeper and deeper into sleep, it’s head would lower into the water until it would wake up. Her mother would then rub her back to sleep.

This is perhaps nowhere more important than across the world’s boreal forests, the greatest terrestrial carbon sink on the planet.
Photographed from a helicopter over northern Alberta, this image shows dead and dying aspen as a result of climate change. The dead and dying aspen can be differentiated from the healthy aspen in this frame by their lack of leaves. Other sections of dying aspen and be seen extending to the horizon. “Aspen Dieback” as a result of climate change has made these aspen forests susceptible to many pests and other threats. All across boreal forests, increasingly large numbers of aspen are being decimated by Aspen Dieback. As aspen become unhealthy they lose their leaves, eventually die, and then fall to the forest floor and decompose releasing their tremendous stores of carbon back into the atmosphere and creating a vicious cycle by further fuelling climate change and the conditions that will likely result in even more extensive Aspen Dieback and more intense global warming in the future.

Although otters are able to feed on a variety of prey, many otters tend to specialize in one or two prey items and will often revisit the same foraging areas over and over. In the case of mussels it is advantageous to revisit the same exact cluster because once they break through to the rock it becomes easier to peel off mussels on the edge.

She is a leader of the ""Guxo"" initiative and was running as the candidate of the Vetëvendosje Movement for president.

In 2008 the Republic of Kosovo declared independence from Serbia, until then it was a Serbian province.

Relations between the two countries began to normalize in 2013, as a part of the Brussels Agreement.

Vasfije is a Kosovo Albanian activist and politician serving in the Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo where she focuses on the support for the survivors of wartime sexual violence. With her family's support she was the first woman to publicly acknowledged her rape in 2017. Nobody has been convicted in her case. Official estimates suggest that as many as 20,000 women were raped during the 1998-1999 conflict between ethnic Albanian guerrillas and Serbian forces. No perpetrators were punished for any of those acts. In April 2021, Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani declared April 14th, the day of Krasniqi's rape, the ""Day of Sexual Violence Survivors.“

The village has a majority of ethnic Serbs with about 60 Albanian houses at the other end of the settlement.

In the second photo Vasfije Krasniqi Goodman holds hands with her niece at her brother’s home. Vasfije was raped by Serbian police at the age of 16 and her brother has fought for her wellbeing and justice ever since.

Vasfije is a Kosovo Albanian activist and politician serving in the Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo where she focuses on the support for the survivors of wartime sexual violence. With her family's support she was the first woman to publicly acknowledged her rape in 2017. Nobody has been convicted in her case. Official estimates suggest that as many as 20,000 women were raped during the 1998-1999 conflict between ethnic Albanian guerrillas and Serbian forces. No perpetrators were punished for any of those acts. In April 2021, Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani declared April 14th, the day of Krasniqi's rape, the ""Day of Sexual Violence Survivors.“

In 2008 the Republic of Kosovo declared independence from Serbia, until then it was a Serbian province. Between 1998-1999 Serbian troops and ethnic Albanian separatists fought a war which was ended by a NATO air campaign against Serbian forces. The Republic of Kosovo was recognized by over 100 countries, among them  the U.S. and most of EU countries. Serbia continues to claim it as part of its own sovereign territory with support from Russia (its close ally) and China. Relations between the two countries began to normalize in 2013, as a part of the Brussels Agreement.

The ongoing event marks the first time this volcano has erupted since 1971. The island of La Palma is part of the Spanish Canary Islands and is one of the most volcanically active zones in the archipelago with a population of about 85,000 people. The latest eruption was preceded by several earthquake swarms. Careful monitoring allowed officials to begin some evacuations before the lava started flowing, after 30 days of eruption more than 7000 villagers have been evacuated and almost 1000 homes have been destroyed by the ongoing eruption.

Aspen Dieback brought about by prolonged drought as a result of climate change has made these aspen forests susceptible to insect infestation and other threats. Aspen become increasingly unhealthy, eventually dying and falling. Tent caterpillars are thought to be a major cause of Aspen Dieback but research is in the early stages and much is still unknown.

The problem of climate change induced Aspen Dieback is compounded by the fact that the boreal forest is the world’s greatest terrestrial carbon sink as well as one its most concentrated and as a result it is one of our greatest allies in the fight against climate change and global warming. However as these aspen forests die and decompose they release their massive stored carbon into the atmosphere further fuelling climate change and the conditions that are causing Aspen Dieback.

Two times a week, the specialist helps him improve his reading and speaking skills and pronunciation. Speech therapy is essential for his social and future professional integration.

In 2020, months of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in loss of regular medical care, making Nathanaël’s development more difficult. The sessions resumed this year but health regulations created new difficulties for the young boy.

Chinese laborers reached Monument Point in April 1869, and it was established as a maintenance station to care for the track near its location.

Historians estimate that at any one time, between 10,000 and 15,000 Chinese laborers were working on constructing the western portion of North America's first transcontinental railroad, suffering over 1000 casualties, most undocumented. 

Follow me @philipcheungphoto as I continue photographing the history of the Central Pacific Railroad and acknowledge the crucial role that the Chinese railroad workers had in America.

In the second video, a young phd researcher from Padua University sails to a slat marsh for rising biological samples.
Venice would not be Venice without its surrounding water basin. With 550 km2 (212 square miles) of surface area, it is the largest wetland of the Mediterranean. It is divided from the sea by a strip of barrier islands, the littoral, that runs for about 60 km, interrupted by the lagoon inlets. Inside the lagoon basin is Venice and more than 50 islands, about 40 km2 of salt marsh, and a 1,500 km network of canals. The depth of the lagoon is generally between 1m and 3m. Since 1987, the Venice Lagoon is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site list.
The erosion of the lagoon, due to the increased flow of water from the sea, and pollution, are just some of the problems that are threatening this unique ecosystem. Water, mud, and slime are on the surface of this world with surreal traits, where large container ships, cruises, fishermen and hunters share the same water space.
Both the EU and Italian governments have launched a large program to re-build this ecosystem, with the construction of sandbanks and artificial islands.",10705,2021-09-23,https://scontent-mad1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/242489987_250749800288899_4663107268407978080_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-mad1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=_KS2X_1DWC0AX-GZZNU&edm=ABmJApABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MjY2OTAzMDgxOTkyNTE1NDE0NQ%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfC03106GBoC5ebmYdfYXR-RGH2bjM7tuJ6P1oexQhkI8g&oe=6417637A&_nc_sid=6136e7,imagenpreubaJ269-1.jpg,"Photo by Nat Geo in the Field on September 23, 2021.",269,10,[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Protected by The Nature Conservancy (@tnc_nc), this old growth forest is one of the few remaining virgin swamps left in the United States. With the record age of 2,624 years, these sentinel trees have witnessed millennia of storms, hurricanes, droughts, fires, sunrises and moon sets. But on September 15, 2021 at precisely 8:06pm, the sky illuminated with a new and historic feature. SpaceX’s Inspiration4 flight ushered in a new era becoming the first all-civilian crew to reach orbit. The launch was visible in North Carolina for only 120 seconds. While deep in the swamp, I noticed something strange streaking behind the canopy. Alarmed, I yelled in confusion to my assistant, Zach, thinking it was a comet or a rocket. I quickly recomposed my camera and captured the SpaceX rocket heading northeast across the heavens. It was incredible to witness and what also struck me was the duality of the moment—new technology soaring over ancient trees.

The fire is comprised of the Paradise and Colony Fires, both lightning ignited blazes that started last week. The fire was close to the Giants Grove of Giant Sequoias in the park, as crews worked to protect infrastructure and the trees in advance of the fire. The National Park Service has conducted numerous prescribed burns over the years in Giant Sequoia Groves, and fire crews are optimistic that this previous managed “good fire” will allow a healthy burn to move through the forest around some famous trees like the General Sherman and others, if or when the fire reaches the area. The reduced fuel loading will reduce fire intensity.

As of the morning update the fire has not yet reached Giant Sequoia Groves. Giant Sequoias are adapted for life with wildfire, but intense fire conditions that reach the crowns can damage and kill them. Last year at the Castle Fire experts estimate 10% of the Giant Sequoias in the region were damaged or killed. After an intense fire season covering major wildfires and drought throughout the state, I look forward to continuing to document this important story on one of America’s treasured national parks and groves of trees. Currently the complex is nearly 9,000 acres and 0% contained.

Inspired by the educational projects of northern Europe, the project involves fifteen children from 2 to 6 years old and their families.
Following the principles of the Pedagogy of the Forest, and Experiential Learning, the children have the opportunity to carry out recreational activities in the woods, in direct contact with nature, during all seasons.
This image is part of the series ""Growing in the Woods”, a documentation project supported by @InsideNatGeo’s Emergency Fund for Journalists.
Bergamo was one of the hardest-hit cities in the world during the first wave of the pandemic in March 2020.
The health emergency, which has overwhelmed Italy like few other countries in the world, has undoubtedly put the school system in serious difficulty. In particular, it has highlighted how this needs new, and safe, spaces, and a rethinking of the teaching method.
From January to June 2021, I documented 6 schools located in 6 different areas of the country, from North to South, in an attempt to tell the story of the diversity of the territories, the change of the seasons, and how these are intrinsically linked to the experiences of the children.
We live in a society that has the duty to find a different relationship with nature.
Through the photographic documentation of these stories, my goal is to spark reflection and debate, on a fundamental issue.

These animals are very territorial and are used to fighting for pack leadership. In this case, Cherokee was defeated and suffered an ugly broken shoulder. Veterinary surgery for livestock is not available on the island where Jenifer lives so a dog vet tried to fix it by fitting a prothesis but he wasn’t able to successfully and unfortunately Cherokee passed away. Jenifer may have decided to euthanize Cherokee from the very first moment as most of the ranchers usually do but she chose to give it an opportunity even though she is almost bankrupt.

In the Canary Islands, the southernmost region of Spain, where Jenifer lives, the primary sector is going through a terrible crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thousands of farmers in the country have been waiting for almost a year for public subsidies from Europe, but the response from the continent has been slow. Additionally, the Canaries are still trying to escape the 2008 economic crisis that hit the region harder than any other place in Spain, with unemployment rates that have risen 35% (25% in 2021).

In 2008, the single-mother adopted her first child Nathanaël, then Magdaléna and Abellino. They were all born with Down Syndrome.

The children have textbooks to work on over the summer holiday to help them retain information learned over the preceding school year, which has been challenging due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Here Élodie is seen helping her 13-year-old son Nathanaël doing mathematics by showing him how to count with hands clapping.

From the circumstances forcing them north, through Central America and Mexico to the United States, they’ve faced unthinkable challenges.

Recently I teamed up with writer Aurora Almendral (@aurora_alm) for a @natgeo story about how Kataleya and Alexa are adjusting to their new lives in the United States.

While Kataleya found a room to rent in Virginia with a friend, their transphobic landlord insulted them on a regular basis, threatening to call the police if they didn’t leave by the end of the month. Kataleya decided to move to Texas into the apartment of a Honduran man she’d known online for three years. Hearing of the less expensive living conditions and with the prospect of more stability, she felt it was a more secure option.

These are some images of Kataleya’s hectic moving day, treasured items she took with her, and the beginning of her unexpected journey to Texas. Many thanks as well to @womenphotograph for supporting part of this project.

These images are in no particular order, but the last image has a nice story to it. The runner is Harvard Vatnhamar of the Faroe Islands. At age 45 he is the ONLY competitor for his country participating in the Paralympics. He was in last when I shot this photo of him at the halfway point of the race. But he ran the most of the race cheering, yelling, smiling at the crowds, who went crazy as he made his way through. And he actually worked his way up the field by the end of it finishing 10th. Harvard is what the Paralympics and actually what all sports should be about. It’s not about competing but participating and just showing up, and in doing so you give something positive to those around you. It’s all about the journey getting to the start and the finish line!

Arabella is a 3rd generation descendant of Hung Lai Woh, a railroad worker who arrived in the United States in the mid-1860s from Dai Long Village, in the Guangdong Province of Southern China, as a teenager, to work for the Central Pacific Railroad.

Historians estimate that at any one time, between 10,000 and 15,000 Chinese laborers were working on constructing the western portion of North America's first transcontinental railroad, suffering hundreds of casualties, most undocumented.

Follow me @philipcheungphoto as I continue photographing the history of the Central Pacific Railroad and acknowledge the crucial role that the Chinese railroad workers had in America.

Like other marine mammals, sea otters are known to haul out of the water. In healthy animals, sea otters haul out for a variety of reasons but is mostly attributed to avoiding predators, warming up and conserving energy. Life in the sea is extreme for sea otters and without proper heavy blubber as insulation, sea otters are constantly walking a fine line between making it and emales with pups are especially vulnerable to energy depletion between caring and feeding their pups.

Follow @ralphpace for more on otters in CA . Shot on assignment for an upcoming @natgeo article.

Sea otter pups are born too buoyant to dive and will rely on their mother exclusively for the first two months and are typically fully weened by six months. These six months are very hard on the mother and very important for the pup. There is lots to learn for the baby to be successful on its own. In addition to needing to forage for herself, she will need to feed the baby along with teaching it how to successfully groom itself, forage, use tools and make a living in the harsh ocean.

It’s a wonderful treat to work on a story in my home town of Monterey, CA. Sometimes, I will be working on my boat and when I look up and this cuteness swims by.

Follow @ralphpace for more on otters in CA while working on the upcoming @natgeo story.

Southern sea otters are currently listed as endangered but numbers are much better than they once were. Extensive fur hunting throughout the 18th and 19th almost drove the population to extinction. It was thought otters were extinct in California until 1914, when a small remnant population of otters was found in Big Sur, CA. Through protection and massive efforts by scientists and conservationists the population in California has rebounded to nearly 3,000 today but has now plateaued.

California sea otters only inhabit 13% of their traditional range due to limited kelp forests and predation from a growing number of great white sharks. But, plans are in the works to potentially help these otters out by relocating/reintroducing them to their old range.

Over the next few months I’ll be diving and working with conservationists to document these remarkable animals. For more on this story you can follow @ralphpace & @natgeointhefield

I chose as a background this blue plastic, used for different functions in the city, such as street commerce, or even as a raincoat.

On this blue background there is a series of images that constitute memories of how the city coexisted with water, and the transformation it underwent over time.

Here’s a little #Behindthescenes and, I have to say, this isn’t footage isn't sped up.

La Palma Island (Canary Islands), in the southernmost region of Spain, is a small island. Thanks to its agricultural industry the island is suffering less than other islands in wake of COVID-19 the archipelago's tourism industry. Farmers on the island have seen a huge decline in exports nevertheless. There used to be many cargo ships transporting food between the Canary Islands and the continent; now, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are far fewer.

So many dreams & expectations go into these Games, from the host country, to the athletes, to the media, that once it comes to an end one can’t help but feel a bit of PED (Post Event Depression). Amplified more by the fact we all had to wait through an extremely difficult year to get to where we are today.

To strike gold at an Olympic Games is no easy feat. Not only do you have to be the best in your country in your specific event, but then be the best on the planet in that given moment on the biggest world stage. For those who have trained their entire lives for this moment, the fact of the matter is that for every athlete who receives a gold medal at the Olympics, there are over 200 who fall short. In a world where athletes are judged and monetized by how much hardware hangs around their necks, this is a harsh reality to swallow. It would be great to see media put less emphasis on the medal count but rather on the stories of their journeys from the start to the finish line.

As a photographer going into these Olympics I had low expectations due to the uncertainty leading up to it, but I can say without hesitation that the Tokyo 2020 Games exceeded all my expectations. For the kindness & pride of the Japanese hosts who somehow pulled off the largest event since Covid-19 changed our planet, you are all amazing. Thank you to all volunteers at every venue and the photo managers who facilitated the positions to the photos we shot. It’s amazing how much planning goes into each image and event you shoot at the Olympics.

Special thanks to @natgeo @natgeointhefield @natgeoadventure and @jeffheimsath who had faith in me and went to bat for me when I pitched the idea of covering @tokyo2020 @olympics

I have an Olympic tradition that I usually shoot Equestrian Team Finals as one of my last assignments of the Games. Ended up seeing the only wave of my trip, glad it was of my favorite Japanese woodblock print “The Great Wave off Kanagawa” 神奈川沖浪裏 by the Japanese artist Hokusai. Seemed like a fitting backdrop for a jump and an added bonus with @martinfuchs_official on his white horse Clooney against the night sky.

Almost to the finish line here in Tokyo, the Japanese have done an amazing job as hosts pulling off one of the most difficult Olympic Games amidst Covid-19.

Day 15: 🇨🇦🥇
Oh Canada!

Comeback from deficit at halftime, tied at end of regulation, tied at end of 2nd overtime, and down on penalty kicks. But somehow the Canadians held in there and won the gold medal. What a gritty performance and great game…

Felt bad for Swedes who controlled 1st half, time of possession, shots on goal, and were up in penalty kicks with chance to end it twice. Props to Canadian goalie Stephanie Labbe @stephlabbe1 who played lights out after the first goal. @teamcanada @canadasoccer

After long game, long bus ride back to Tokyo it’s now 5am and can’t edit anymore. Time to sleep before my last day shooting! Finish line in site!

Tai is a 6th generation descendant of Lim Lip Hong, one of the first Chinese hired by the Central Pacific Railroad in 1864, where he worked as a headman. Historians estimate that at any one time, between 10,000 and 15,000 Chinese laborers were working on constructing the western portion of North America's first transcontinental railroad.

Follow me @philipcheungphoto as I continue photographing the history of the Central Pacific Railroad and acknowledge the crucial role that the Chinese railroad workers had in America.

So today I went for run in the surrounding area around my hotel and it was a completely new world out there. Was smart to take my phone as I was able to take these photos, dumb to run 8 miles in the middle of the day 90 degrees and 90% humidity! 🥵

During the five days, the boys learned about Ojibwe historical & cultural connections to the islands, identifying inner-generational trauma, and paddled canoes 6 miles round trip from the mainland.

A National Park Service biologist gently holds a Piping Plover chick, preparing to release it after an ID band was placed on its leg. To protect the most endangered shore birds of Lake Superior’s Apostle Islands National Park, the NPS, Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa, Wisconsin DNR & the US Fish & Wildlife Service are working together to guard and monitor nesting Piping Plovers on Outer Island and Chequamegon Point on Long Island.

To make this photo, I used a 100mm macro lens (to photograph up close these tiny chicks, as young as 5 days old) at the widest aperture f2.8 to minimize the depth of field and separate the baby bird from the island background.

Walter Blanco visits his grandmother’s grave in Intipuca, El Salvador. She was one of the main reasons Blanco's mother migrated to the United States when he was still a child to send back remittances to support her family. Blanco joined her in Maryland when he turned 13 and got deported to El Salvador in 2001. ""I often wonder if I would have become someone important there,"" he said. ""But I've learned to quickly let go of that thought.""

Elena Mejía, 91, sits by the sewing machine she used to make dresses for women in Intipucá before migrating to the United States. After being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, Mejía returned to live with her son who was deported back to El Salvador in 2001. Moments of her life in the U.S. working as a housekeeper at various hotels are some of the few memories she carries with her today. ⁣

This remote island in the Bering Sea—known as Qayassiq, or ""place to go in a kayak"" in Yup'ik—is home to thousands of male walrus that come to rest on its shores every summer.

Since 1960, the island has been protected as part of the Walrus Islands State Game Sanctuary, where a permit program allows small groups of visitors to camp on the island every summer to observe walrus in the wild. It also remains an important hunting ground for Yup'ik communities who coordinate a subsistence hunt for walrus every fall, continuing the traditions that have taken place here for over 5,700 years.

Here, male walrus gather onshore by the thousands every summer to recuperate after the mating season. One of my favorite things about watching walrus is their incredible grace in the water, and the way their skin quickly changes from pale to rosy in color as they emerge from the cold waters of the Bering Sea and warm up.

Taken on assignment for @natgeo for an upcoming story about Alaska's Walrus Islands State Game Sanctuary.

Alex Morales, 29, works from his home in La Libertad, El Salvador. In 2019, Morales was deported to a country even his mother had shared little about; to him, it felt like the Wild Wild West. But after nearly two years of being back, he is finding his ground. He now runs his own Airbnb and manages other properties at the beach town where his mother grew up. “I’m going to be a big fish in a little pond,” Morales said of his work.

Growing up with immigrant parents who worked several shifts to sustain his family, Morales shares that what keeps him up at night is making sure he gifts his daughter the same opportunities he had going to school in the United States. After living in the U.S. for nearly twenty-four years, Morales was deported to his hometown of La Libertad, El Salvador in 2019.

Close to 47 residents have been diagnosed over the past nine months with COVID and the lack of proper treatment has forced former rebels to seek traditional treatment and homeopathic remedies to treat symptoms of COVID 19.

Marinelly is one of 171 former FARC members in the process of reintegration. Since the signing of the historical peace process between the Colombian Government and FARC (The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) in 2016, former rebels have reunited with families and started their own, despite precarious living conditions at the transitional encampments. The implementation of the peace process has been undermined by politics and slow to fully implement by the current government, creating a climate of uncertainty for many former rebels as they are now the target of selecting killings, discrimination, and ""abandoned and betrayed by the state,"" said Marinelly.",7612,2021-05-18,https://scontent-mad2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/186893120_796349067549419_6698245768215876401_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-mad2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=K3Il82d5DNgAX_iBSXZ&edm=ABmJApABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MjU3NjAxNzMwMTk3ODk0MDI0MQ%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfDIFDO8-cWVzykn4xz-52xbCBEFv2ycLkBUtzHTmn0YCQ&oe=641763B0&_nc_sid=6136e7,imagenpreubaJ435-1.jpg,"Photo by Nat Geo in the Field on May 17, 2021.",435,2,[],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

A strong draught blows through the entrance, which reverses direction according to the seasons. In winter, one gets sucked into the cave, whereas in summer, one has to fight their way against the strong headwind to get inside. The draught is created because the cave has another entrance higher than this one pictured.
In summer, warm outside air blows through the cave from top down, melting the ice formations inside the cave as it does so. As the climate warms the summer melting gets worse and worse each year.

Mary sits in the communal area of the memory care unit at a skilled nursing facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Studies estimate that the mental health fallout of the pandemic will be three times the medical footprint. Psychologists have seen an elevated rate of grief, depression, and anxiety amongst long-term care residents after a year of isolation and loss of community members. Clinicians working with individuals with dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease have noted changes in mood and declines in cognition. While vaccinations have allowed residents to reunite with their families, some states, like New Mexico, have set guidelines that encourage outdoor and scheduled visitation only. In New Mexico, 4,264 long-term care residents contracted Covid-19 and 997 died from the virus since March 2020.

In 1868 the Central Pacific Railroad arrived at the mining and agricultural town. The railroad bolstered its economy by providing a faster way to transport its goods, and like many railroad towns, it had a large Chinese population.

Over the next few months, I will continue photographing the history of the Central Pacific Railroad and acknowledge the crucial role that the Chinese railroad workers had in America.

The health emergency, which has overwhelmed Italy like few other countries in the world, has undoubtedly put the school system in serious difficulty. In particular, it has highlighted how this needs new, and safe, spaces, and a rethinking of the teaching method.
The lack of outdoor experiences faced by the children of today's cities has created a new type of disorder, identified by the scientific community as ""Nature Deficit Disorder"".
Immersion in nature reduces stress in children who are stimulated to develop greater intellectual qualities, health, and serenity.
Building a relationship with Nature from an early age is a prerequisite for developing sensitivity towards the environment and a desire to protect it.

All children should have the right to a ""good start"". The chance to grow up in a clean world, safe in what they drink, eat and the air they breathe. But the water is no longer pure, the air is soaked in all kinds of pollutants, the earth is contaminated by synthetic chemicals. It is said that this is the unwanted fruit of development and progress. Yet today it would also be important to know how to stop and find a necessary balance with our wonderful planet.

Look hard enough and you can find frogs from the Arctic Circle to the Sahara Desert—and practically everywhere in between. But nowhere are they more plentiful than in the rainforests that girdle South America’s equatorial region. At last count, scientists like Dr Bruce Means had cataloged about 1000 different species that live in the Amazon Basin. Of course, these are only the ones we know about, and if Bruce is right, there are likely ten times that number that have yet to be discovered. Sadly, we will never know how many have already been lost to extinction.

According to Bruce, the reason there is so much frog biodiversity in the Amazon is that speciation takes place over evolutionary time, and there is nowhere on earth where frogs have lived for longer. DNA analysis of tree frogs collected on past expeditions in the Paikwa River Basin suggests that many of them took up residence in the region between 70 and 80 million years ago, which is twice as long as they have been living in North America. “About the most profound statement I can make,” says Bruce, “is that the longer life is allowed to proliferate in a rich, untrammeled environment like the Paikwa River Basin, the more that species will differentiate and diversify.”

Over the years, Bruce’s quest to document this biodiversity has become more urgent as he has witnessed firsthand how the “pork-knockers”—freelance Guyanese mining prospectors—have been transforming once pristine rainforests and rivers into poisoned scars in the earth.

Look hard enough and you can find frogs from the Arctic Circle to the Sahara Desert—and practically everywhere in between. But nowhere are they more plentiful than in the rainforests that girdle South America’s equatorial region. At last count, scientists like Dr Bruce Means had cataloged about 1000 different species that live in the Amazon Basin. Of course, these are only the ones we know about, and if Bruce is right, there are likely ten times that number that have yet to be discovered. Sadly, we will never know how many have already been lost to extinction.

According to Bruce, the reason there is so much frog biodiversity in the Amazon is that speciation takes place over evolutionary time, and there is nowhere on earth where frogs have lived for longer. DNA analysis of tree frogs collected on past expeditions in the Paikwa River Basin suggests that many of them took up residence in the region between 70 and 80 million years ago, which is twice as long as they have been living in North America. “About the most profound statement I can make,” says Bruce, “is that the longer life is allowed to proliferate in a rich, untrammeled environment like the Paikwa River Basin, the more that species will differentiate and diversify.”

Over the years, Bruce’s quest to document this biodiversity has become more urgent as he has witnessed firsthand how the “pork-knockers”—freelance Guyanese mining prospectors—have been transforming once pristine rainforests and rivers into poisoned scars in the earth.

“When I saw what was happening, and I realized how many species were going extinct every day,” says Bruce, “I knew that there was no more important contribution I could make to the world than to document as much of this biodiversity as I could before it was lost forever.

Due to global warming and the human invasion of this environment, the global coral reef is disappearing faster than predicted. Coral reef isn't only a tourist attraction, it's the home of an imeasurable number of known and unknown living species. Maldivian identity has a close bond with the coral. The coral reef is the barrier that protects them from the wide ocean and it is the material from which their ancient buildings were made.

The establishment of Lovelock started with building the Central Pacific Railroad through the area in 1868, which also stimulated the local livestock and agriculture industry, and like many railroad towns, it had a large Chinese population.

Over the next few months, I will continue photographing the history of the Central Pacific Railroad and acknowledge the crucial role that the Chinese railroad workers had in America.

But this epochal moment could be an opportunity to rethink our society and to give a chance to ecological education, a cultural premise towards sustainability. The conditions are all there. In Western countries six out of ten citizens demand education to be one of the main objectives, even before economic development, of the post-coronavirus. The health emergency, which has overwhelmed Italy like few other countries in the world, has undoubtedly put the school system in serious difficulty. In particular, it has highlighted how this needs new, and safe, spaces, and a rethinking of the teaching method. The lack of outdoor experiences faced by the children of today's cities has created a new type of disorder, identified by the scientific community as ""Nature Deficit Disorder"". Building a relationship with Nature from an early age is a prerequisite for developing sensitivity towards the environment and a desire to protect it.
Thanks to the support of @InsideNatGeo’s Emergency Fund for Journalist in the coming months I will be working on a project to document the most important outdoor education entities in my country.
We live in a society that has the duty to find a different relationship with nature. Through this project, my goal is to spark reflection and debate, on a fundamental issue.

I have been following the two marine biologists, Davide Seveso and Simone Montano, from MaRHE Center, University Bicocca Milan, while they are monitoring the reef restoration program. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the two biologists couldn't visit Maldives. When they arrived on the island reef, both scientists were surprised by the strong growth of the coral, probably due to the absence of the massive tourism and intense human activity.

Coral reef world wide is living an intense crisis due to global warming. Maldives is an archipelago of 1192 islands made and protected by coral. The consequence of the reef desappearing could cause an intense erosion of the island shore from the ocean waves. This group of marine biologists are selecting the strongest coral that can survive bleaching and other illnesses.

Ahmad, 35 years old, from Maafushi, Male Atoll, Maldives. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, he lost his work and now still unemployed. As many of Maldivians he was rising some money sailing little boat for tourists. I met him near the local jetty, while he was sit on the tipical Maldivian chair, and speaking with his friend Rashid. They spoke to me directly in Italian, and told about how the Maldivan identiy and life style has been changed in the last decades thanks to the tourism. As many of them, they left their old occupantion as fishermans, to join some tour operator.

Maldives is the lowest country in the world with an average ground-level elevation of 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) above sea level, and a highest natural point of only 5.1 metres (17 ft). Following the IPCC report within 2100 the level of the ocean could rise up to 1 mt due to the climate change. With this prediction, many of the 1192 island could disappear.

It’s safe to say we could count on one hand the times there was a ‘view’ beyond the jungle canopy on this expedition. It often happened in 10-30 min pulses like this of dancing clouds and waterfalls.

Do these type of clouds even have a name?!

“The goal of 2021 @natgeo Lost World Expedition was an elevational transect of the Upper Paikwa River Basin near Guyana’s northwestern frontier with Brazil and Venezuela to look for new species of amphibians and reptiles in one of the world’s richest and least explored hotspots of biodiversity. The final section of our transect led us through a pristine, untouched cloud forest and culminated with a first ascent of an unclimbed 7,000-foot tepui called Weiassipu.” - writer @m_synnott

The cliff continued for another 400 feet above us, but the narrow, vegetated ledge on which we had spent the night appeared to offer an end run to Weiassipu’s summit plateau. After weeks of living in the jungle, it was time to complete our elevational transect and turn our attention toward home.

We set off around 9am, bushwhacking our way south through a hanging, Dr. Seussian forest of twisted, moss-covered trees and dense thickets of saw grass, reeds, and vines. In places, the vegetation was so thick that the only way forward was to crawl on our hands and knees through tunnels wreathed in spider webs heavy with dew. Through openings in the shrubbery, we caught occasional views across the valley toward the east face of Mount Roraima. It had rained overnight, and the tepui was ornamented with a dozen or so massive cascades, including the legendary Diamond Waterfall, which burst from a hole in the side of the cliff like a scene from the movie Up.

After half a mile, the ledge turned a corner and we found ourselves staring in awe across the summit plateau. Twin towers rose in the distance above a vapor-filled sinkhole that incised the summit like a bottomless abyss. In the span of a few feet, we had stepped from a cloud forest into a quaking bog covered in pitcher plants, yucca and bizarre Venus fly trap-like carnivorous plants. It started to rain. Mist poured over the tepui rim. Soon we were lost in a lost world, the fog so thick we could barely see each other as we fanned out, desperate to find a frog—or at least something vaguely resembling a summit.

Eventually, Fuco and I met up in an area where car sized, tabletop rocks balanced atop tiny pedestals. Alex Honnold was MIA. We crawled beneath a mushroom-shaped rock and huddled together under my poncho. No one said anything. We just stared into the gloom. But I know we were thinking the same thing: That summits have a funny way of not living up to one’s expectations—and finding new species of frogs on a tepui is not for the faint of heart.

We flew into the heart of Alaska’s Brooks Range blind, wrapped in high white gauze. Louie, the pilot, was unfazed. He ate oranges and steered through passes we could only imagine. But soon the clouds dissolved and there it was—the town of Anaktuvuk Pass, home of the Nunamiut, who have lived and hunted in these mountains for generations. They settled here only in 1950 and chose the spot for good reason. Anaktuvuk means “the place of many caribou droppings,” and the Nunamiut are linked to the animals, spiritually and practically. As Louie circled town we saw them down on the plain—small groups of caribou, little families, wandering over the snow, waiting for the right moment to push north toward their calving grounds. A boy later asked us why we’d come and we said, To learn about caribou.

The goal of 2021 @natgeo Lost World Expedition is an elevational transect of the Upper Paikwa River Basin near Guyana’s northwestern frontier with Brazil and Venezuela to look for new species of amphibians and reptiles in one of the world’s richest and least explored hotspots of biodiversity. The final section of our transect led us through a pristine, untouched cloud forest and culminated with a first ascent of an unclimbed 7,000-foot tepui called Weiassipu.

Santiago was the son of the pro-independence and socialist leader Juan Mari Bras, his murder is largely seen as a political attack on the independence movement on the Island.

Jose “Fefel” Varona died 53 years ago on March 25, 1968 as a result of a U.S. Airforce bombing in Vietnam; possibly making him one of the only U.S. Citizens to die not by friendly fire.

This may be one of the world’s harshest drylands but it is overflowing with life, home to some of the continent’s most unique animals. Meerkats, pangolins, aardvarks, Cape cobras, sociable weavers and many more species have evolved exceptional behaviors to endure extreme temperatures, optimize unpredictable rainfalls, and survive seasonal food shortages. But now climate change threatens to severely disrupt if not eliminate this 60 million-year-old ecosystem in less than 60 years, causing these interdepended iconic species to fall like desert dominos.

I am currently in the Kalahari to document and tell the story of the regions animals and plants, the threats they face and the cutting edge climate change research carried out by the scientists of the @tswalufoundation and the @k.e.e.p_kalahari_project_

Science and the search for new species was the raison d’etre of the 2021 @natgeo Lost World Expedition, but the actual beating heart of our expedition was the team of native Akawaios who served as guides, porters, citizen scientists and friends. Some of 70-odd Akawaois who accompanied us live in this village, which is called Wayalayeng. It is home to about 50 families and can only be accessed by foot or boat. To reach Wayalayeng we flew to the village of Phillipai from Georgetown and then proceeded via the Kukui and Ataro Rivers aboard dugout canoes with outboard motors.

Over the years that I have been exploring our planet, I have secretly dreamed that one day I might find a real Shangri-La. The term was coined by British author James Hilton in his 1933 novel, Lost Horizon, and is defined as “a remote beautiful imaginary place where life approaches perfection; utopia.” It is tempting to project this vision onto Wayalayeng, and I’ll admit that I have. But the truth is that life in this village is hard. Wayalayeng lacks basic amenities that many of us take for granted in our daily lives—electricity, running water, cellular communications and medical care.

Wayalayeng sits on the edge of a plateau, and the land is ideally suited to the creation of a landing strip. I spoke with Akawaios both for and against the idea, but the consensus seems to be for maintaining the status quo. An airstrip would bring miners into the area. Apparently, there are outsiders who currently hold over 100 mining claims in the area. So far, the Akawaois have held them off. For hundreds of years, they have lived communally, subsisting on crops of cassava and hunting for fish, deer, tapirs and agoutis. Their vision of sustainability for this remote corner of the world has been passed down from one generation to the next—and it does not include mining. No one knows better than the Akawaios that the real treasures of El Dorado are not gold and diamonds, but the plants, animals and people who call this magical place home. #TheLostWorldExpedition @expedition.studios #Akawaios",35940,2021-03-16,https://scontent-mad2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/161019500_944728829399620_1364579538223510579_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-mad2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=H708RULaz3MAX_cipv-&edm=ABmJApABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MjUzMDI5ODU3Mzg4NDgzOTI2Ng%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfDFrN4Uj5NuYWySLpev1eE9mn5fbjtQHGJY62yMdlhQpQ&oe=6416F508&_nc_sid=6136e7,imagenpreubaJ530-1.jpg,"Photo by Nat Geo in the Field on March 15, 2021.",530,0,"['#TheLostWorldExpedition', '#Akawaios']",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The goal of 2021 @natgeo Lost World Expedition was an elevational transect of the Upper Paikwa River Basin near Guyana’s northwestern frontier with Brazil and Venezuela to look for new species of amphibians and reptiles in one of the world’s richest and least explored hotspots of biodiversity. The final section of our transect led us through a pristine, untouched cloud forest and culminated with a first ascent of an unclimbed 7,000-foot tepui called Weiassipu.

The expedition was led by @dr_bruce_means, an intrepid 80-year-old ecologist and evolutionary biologist whose life’s work has been to catalog and document the unique flora and fauna of South America’s tepui region. Tepuis, which rise high above the rainforest like tabletop mesas, are made from some of the oldest rock on Earth, iron-hard orange quartzite that is 1.6 to 1.8 billion years old. These “Lost Worlds” represent the last remaining vestiges of an ancient plateau called the Guiana Shield, and their summits have been called “islands in the sky” on account of the endemic species that often occur only on a single mountaintop.

For more about why biodiversity matter and details on the new species of frogs discovered on this expedition (not pictured), please stay tuned for a feature article in the Yellow Book, as well as a @natgeotv episode directed by @taylorfreesolo with Renan.

For now, we’d like to thank the incredible team that worked tirelessly to document this story including Alex Honnold, Federico Pisana, Matt Irving, Ryan Valasek, Rudy Lehfeldt Ehlinger, Brian Irwin and most importantly, the team of indigenous Akawaios who we’ll be telling you more about in our next post. #TheLostWorldExpedition #BiodiversityMatters",39450,2021-03-12,https://scontent-mad1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/159130374_226442272537671_2108317465378323120_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-mad1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=mLSRGFm14owAX-sAUTJ&edm=ABmJApABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MjUyNzgzOTAwMzgxMjAyMTA1Nw%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfChxuG4tW49hLZp1CU8p_pzyGWxo5BMRmB2GS93nhFhgw&oe=641799E2&_nc_sid=6136e7,imagenpreubaJ531-1.jpg,"Photo shared by Nat Geo in the Field on March 12, 2021 tagging @natgeo, and @renan_ozturk.",531,15,"['#TheLostWorldExpedition', '#BiodiversityMatters']",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

In the book, an insomnia plague strikes the fictional, isolated town of Macondo and nobody really understands what is happening to them at first.
The COVID-19 pandemic hit the poor and remote region in Dagestan, with an obsolete medical system, most when the pandemic first started in Russia. The local nurses thought at first that it was the annual flu but once their patients started dying and falling sick in masses they didn’t understand what was happening, nor how to treat it, nor were they provided with any medical equipment and medicine.
I was particularly saddened to see sick, pregnant women and young children suffering COVID-19 symptoms, being surrounded by cosmonaut-looking medical staff. I visited the only COVID-19 maternity ward in Dagestan, in the capital Makhachkala and photographed the birth where the newborn was immediately isolated from her sick mother.

We had just decided to start telling friends we were expecting a baby when COVID-19 forced us into lockdown. It felt contradictory to be hopeful for the future while the world was shutting down. To grow a life in such dark times of death felt powerful and I wanted to document it for my daughter.

I am a pretty private person and I never would have imagined I would share such a personal set of images, but I think the pandemic made me lose my inhibitions in documenting and sharing my story. The pandemic stripped away a lot of fears and amplified my desire to connect with others.

Their vast connection with biodiversity and traditional plant-based medicine are under threat amid the coronavirus pandemic.

During the pandemic in Peru, I accompanied the Shipibo-Konibo people in their quest to survive this violent disease. I was able to enter their world and understand why they consider the plants of the Amazon to be like doctors protecting humanity. I saw them take refuge in their origin, in their forest and I felt myself take refuge with them.

Only a few weeks from being summoned to present her case, which included testimony of being beaten up by her transphobic brother back in Honduras, COVID-19 hit and the U.S./Mexico border closed indefinitely to asylum seekers, hurtling her life into a downward spiral of depression and instability with employment, living situations, and safety.

Breonna Leon is a geriatric nurse in Atlanta, Georgia and has seen many of her patients die from COVID-19. She believes Black Americans were dying at higher rates due to issues dealing with systemic racism in healthcare, access to adequate and healthy foods, education level, and empathy in the medical field. When a historic event like COVID-19 happens, we are at a disadvantage health-wise due to the pre-existing conditions we have. This is largely due to unhealthy diet and the consumption of highly processed foods. Through my research and documentation, I had an intimate look at how food deserts are plaguing black communities in Atlanta.

With Mardi Gras being cancelled this year it was still important for her to make a costume. “My costume came from a desire to embody the Mississippi River. 
The idea is to look like a creature that crawls out onto the shore of the Mississippi. The chainmail, decorated in bait and fishing lures, represents a cast net to catch shrimp, oysters and crawfish. The glass beads are hand-strung from glass bead parade throws from Mardi Gras past. I wanted to embody the Mississippi River as an integral part of New Orleans and its history. It’s also an important destination on Mardi Gras day to reach the river at the end of Saint Anne parade. It’s the point in the day when you feel like you can take a deep breath, and finally sit down on the river steps, bump into familiar faces and mysterious creatures in costume, and really feel connected to your community. The Saint Anne parade originally started to go the the river to pay homage to those who have lost their lives to HIV.

The Flaming Flagettes are a drag flag team that have been performing every Mardi Gras since 2016. The group mother's are Jacob Reptile and Chris Staudinger.  Jacob explains ""After my house fire in 2016 I moved in With Chris Staudinger (our other krewe motha)  and told him About an idea of creating an all drag flag group, so we gathered up a bunch of queeridos and after the first meeting we decided we were truly the Flaming Flagettes, an all drag flag team and we performed for the first time at the Southern Decadence parade 2016, with about a dozen people.  Every parade worthy holiday we have performed since! Except Halloween. I used to march in the 9th Ward Marching Band as a ribbon dancer. We used to march the Endymion Saturday through the neighborhood. We (9th ward Marching Band) don’t march anymore really so the flagettes filled the hole that it created in the neighborhood.
Every Mardi Gras we usually perform at a Carnival Ball and the Saturday before Tuesday we choregraph a few songs and dance down the streets welcoming other krewes like Krewe De Nim and Spirit Sticks to join us. And the whole neighborhood comes out to dance with us and basically bar crawl the gay bars throught the Marigny and French Quarter. But as of Covid-19, we started making music videos instead of doing parades. We dont want to promote gatherings or lead to anyone being unsafe so we release the video the same time we would be marching to help brighten peoples day. We have done three videos and I suppose we will continue at least with Easter and we cant wait to dance again with everyone!” You can check out their IGTV for videos.",7567,2021-02-16,https://scontent-mad1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/150391572_412547923384637_2113588685368256150_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-mad1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=-iJ1vEA_jmcAX--eMaW&edm=ABmJApABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MjUxMDUzMDQ2NDM5NTU0NjQ3MQ%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfDB7BDOPTqGuoH1brVBG6JRxZuksydxgsHBIZpDMuUnig&oe=6418A54B&_nc_sid=6136e7,imagenpreubaJ562-1.jpg,"Photo by Nat Geo in the Field on February 16, 2021.",562,18,[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In the last 20 years, Mina and an entire generation of largely urban Afghans have grown up with all the basic liberties that the Taliban had erased during the rulings in the 90s.

The Gila is the first designated wilderness area in the United States. This milestone of American conservation was created in 1924 thanks in large part to Aldo Leopold, a philosopher, writer, forester, and outdoor enthusiast considered by many to be the father of wildlife ecology. Leopold envisioned wilderness as a place to be protected both for, and from, humans, “Wilderness is the one kind of playground which mankind cannot build to order…. I contrived to get the Gila headwaters withdrawn as a wilderness area, to be kept as pack country, free from additional roads, ‘forever.'” Meanwhile the Gila’s history began long before Aldo Leopold, and the region’s future is far more complex than he could have ever imagined.

I recently spent several days in Houston photographing the many ways folks there are tackling food insecurity—looking at big institutions like the Houston Food Bank and small ones, like a neighborhood thrift shop in the Third Ward neighborhood that had installed a community refrigerator outside its doors. Their different approaches served different population groups across the city's sprawl (the Houston metro area, home to around seven million, is one of the most diverse in the country) and attested to the need for both small, grassroots initiatives and large-scale ones.

Lake Naivasha is a shallow freshwater lake situated in the eastern Rift Valley of Kenya, about 80 km north of Nairobi. It is ranked third behind Lake Victoria and Lake Turkana in the total volume of fish landed and provides livelihoods, water, and food to thousands who live on its shores. Even though naturally subject to considerable fluctuations in water level, heavy rainfall from February to June 2020 caused massive flooding and submerged private properties of hundreds of families and businesses located along the edges of the lake. In May this year, lake Naivasha reached its highest level since 1932.

Rather than focusing on the winding lines of those waiting for food in the wake of the pandemic, I wanted to create a space to connect with the people I was photographing, and hear more about their situations. Those who wanted to could come over for a portrait and an interview during the hours they spent waiting for food. Luz is currently out of work and so is her whole family. She lives with her mother, her children and her brother. She says she’s very grateful for all the help she’s received in the midst of such a difficult situation. She worked for an 87-year-old man, taking care of him for the last 15 years. He got COVID-19 and died two weeks later, and since then she’s been without work.

Queens was was hit very hard by the first wave of the pandemic in NYC in the spring. The community is largely essential workers, from delivery drivers to cooks, cleaners, and construction workers, many of whom did not have the option to work from home. With population density and many living in tight quarters, infection rates in the area were very high. Tragic losses of life were compounded by the economic fallout, as many lost their jobs or had their incomes cut, and a continued high cost of living in the city. Now Queens is wrestling with rampant food insecurity. Families struggling to make ends meet are finding innovative ways to participate in the informal economy and depending on food donations to get by, and churches, government programs, and community organizations are mobilizing to help in every way they can.

There were empty and gray cemeteries, without the aromas of marigolds and incense, without mariachis or ”Norteños.” La Catrina (the death) was alone in her domain and the very same pandemic seemed to enlarge her, to make her gigantic.

Ironically, when José Guadalupe Posada, creator of La Catrina, died in Tepito, he died alone and forgotten, his remains were forgotten in a common grave.

“Death, as José Guadalupe Posada taught us, is the art of passing away to a better life,” said writer Juan Villoro.

Lake Naivasha is ranked third behind Lake Victoria, and Lake Turkana in the total volume of fish landed and provides livelihoods, water, and food to thousands who live on its shores and beyond. From February to June 2020, heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding in many lakes in East Africa. These calamities coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic and affected ecosystems and livelihoods. Especially vulnerable were communities such as fishermen, who depend on fisheries as their only source of income. The measures instituted by the Kenyan government to reduce the spread of COVID-19 further aggravated this situation. The dusk to dawn curfew and the cessation of movement to cities, which are the main fish markets such as Nairobi, disrupted the fish supply chain.

From what the Karuk and Yurok people of Northern California tell me, 100 years of fire suppression in the US has made Americans afraid of fire. Yet even today, the tribes of NorCal practice ‘good fire’, which is generally low-intensity prescribed burning, making the landscape more suitable for acorn-bearing oaks, deer, and even salmon. At the same time it removes all the hundred years of unburnt fuel waiting to turn into the next raging wildfire.

Jason Reed, a Karuk tribal member, does a cultural burn near Somes Bar, CA, using his traditional knowledge of conditions to aid fire-resistant species like this oak, while taking out young firs that would eventually shade them out. His family has been practicing fire since the last ice age, meaning that enormous swaths of California have been managed by fire for over 13,000 years.

At their height, from about 760 B.C. to 650 B.C., five Kushite kings ruled all of Egypt from Nubia to the Mediterranean Sea, embarking on ambitious building programs up and down the Nile.

A young boy with a bouquet of marigolds waits for his mother outside a bakery as she buys offerings for Día de los Muertos, or the Day of the Dead, in San Andres Mixquic, Mexico. The yellow flower is strung over headstones and laid on altars, thought to represent the brightness of the sun illuminating a path for the spirits to return to Earth from Mictlán, the underworld. This year, the usually festive traditions around Dia de los Muertos were largely celebrated in private, but the souls of the dead aren’t just in cemeteries, as Mexican Poet Jaime Sabines said “To die is to be everywhere in secret. Because with death you walk; we live with her since we are born.”

This incident led to the deaths of Perry and anywhere from three to 50 members of the Black community, as well as two Klansmen. After the massacre, the Black community was ousted from the town and their lands were confiscated. For the next 65 years Ocoee became a sundown town, where Black people were banned after sunset by threat of violence.

(2) Narisse Spicer's great-grandparents fled Ocoee during the massacre and resettled in Apopka, Florida. “We are 100 years later into this, and we are still dealing with voter intimidation and voter suppression and issues of race and violence. It is definitely time, and well overdue, to start thinking about how we can change the future so that future generations don’t experience the same thing,” she said. (3) Pam Grady stands in front of July Perry’s former land. “We are not mourning the death of July Perry; we are celebrating his bravery,” she told me. “These people paved the way for us to have the right to vote.” (4) J. Carl Devine's grandparents fled Ocoee after the massacre. “When one group is trying to suppress another group from voting, that’s when the whole Constitution is then in jeopardy. When one person is denied, all of us are denied.” (5) Jacqueline Perry Blalock (left) and Sha’ron McWhite are both descendants of July Perry. “Our ancestors laid the foundation of the importance of [expressing] our right to vote, and we need to continue that on so that our future generations will have a better opportunity at an equal life. That is what I would like to see,” McWhite said. (6) The city maintains the site of the former African-American cemetery in Ocoee, but it has yet to acquire the land and create a space for reflection as members of the Black community have proposed.",11680,2020-11-03,https://scontent-mad1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/123609088_1686429111531941_5257105568968383012_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-mad1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=lpeMeMGB4QEAX_Y9v1w&edm=ABmJApABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MjQzNDQ2NzMyODc1Mjk5MjMxMQ%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfBgPqPLJQwAZuzewDGpZeTJFnbpLqDVJJJDn1xfSiOeBQ&oe=641801F4&_nc_sid=6136e7,imagenpreubaJ679-4.jpg,"Photo by Nat Geo in the Field on November 03, 2020.",679,19,[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

From left: Juan Luis, Camila, Aida, and Loise. The family left Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria and have faced an uphill battle to gain a footing in the states. Yet they've found a community of supportive fellow Puerto Ricans, like Barbara.

When asked if he had faith in the candidates' ability to deliver on campaign promises, Juan Luis said, “We have to see to believe.” Aida answered, “You are talking to a marriage that went through a hurricane, earthquakes, is going through COVID, that came to Florida, and all of a sudden our daughters faced serious health issues—we are survivors. Don’t play me. Don’t talk pretty—act.”

Later in our conversation, she told me, “I want change, I don’t want a circus. I want somebody who will talk to me with integrity.”

Kissimmee and the surrounding area are Latino strongholds in Orlando. The mostly Puerto Rican population saw a sizable bump after roughly 50,000 people fled the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017 and settled in the Orlando area—which had already counted upwards of 380,000 Puerto Ricans.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that although the Puerto Rican community has largely voted Democratic, a segment of the population is ""purpling"" from the votes of an older generation of migrants with more conservative and religious values. Some consider the Latino vote in Florida to be one of the main deciding factors in toss-up counties and regions in this election.",12861,2020-11-03,https://scontent-mad1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/123265570_2751758015098273_903451959088430413_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-mad1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=EzrfnDboa38AX9hV7lQ&edm=ABmJApABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MjQzMzk3Mjg0MDc1NDg2NzgwOA%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfB7lsoQAk-ybHxMCL1t33B4te40jRWjLx-o63bZuf1j0Q&oe=6417777A&_nc_sid=6136e7,imagenpreubaJ687-1.jpg,"Photo by Nat Geo in the Field on November 02, 2020.",687,2,[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

For the past few years, Rev. Robert Turner (pictured) has been one of the loudest voices among the dedicated advocates for finding the lost and demanding reparations for their descendants. Now at least 11 bodies have been found in an unmarked mass grave. While more investigation is needed to verify their identities, finding this grave felt like a complicated moment of relief, rage, and grief for the community.

The 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre remains one of the worst incidents of racial violence in U.S. history, and also one of the least known.

The pandemic has been difficult for everyone, but its been especially tough on this community composed largely of immigrant essential workers, where infection levels were among the highest in New York. A lot of families have been struggling to put food on the table, and church food pantries like this one help to make sure that people dont have to choose between buying food or paying rent. While photographing people waiting, sometimes for hours, for food, I've been bringing my polaroid camera along to snap a few behind the scenes pictures. I find that creating immediate, physical photographs can help make the process of documenting these stories feel a lot more collaborative and interactive. The polaroids often don’t make it into my final projects, but i love their beautiful imperfections and the conversations i have while making them.

I spent hours on Tatham Gap, a remote dirt passage through the mountains. The history of this place is heavy and in the air. The challenge of making a photograph that speaks to something that happened long ago is real.

Tatham Gap runs along the Old Army Road that was built by N.C. troops in early 1838 in preparation for the forced removal of Cherokee citizens, thus making the road a section of the Trail of Tears. The road passes over Snowbird Mountain, elevation 3800 ft. In crossing Snowbird along the Old Army Road, the Cherokee prisoners climbed the highest point along the entire 900-mile Trail of Tears. An estimated 17,000 Cherokee were forced off their homelands and into Oklahoma in 1838. The Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians are descendants of those that hid in the hills, returned from the West, or were allowed to stay through political relationships.

Sudan was once a football pioneer, joining FIFA in 1948 and co-founding the Confederation of African Football with Egypt, Ethiopia and South Africa at a meeting in Khartoum in 1957. But women's football faced an uphill battle after the country adopted the Islamic sharia law in 1983.

Sunsets in the Great Smoky Mountains rarely disappoint. This looks like a moment I experienced in solitude, but there were people picnicking and sitting in camping chairs all around me. As soon as the reds and oranges faded from the sky, they got in their cars and sped away and then, suddenly, I was alone.

Though the landscape has changed over hundreds of years, the mountain horizon and soft sun on a cloudy day persevere.

The town of Chota was an Overhill Cherokee capital in the 1700s. Destroyed in 1780 by American forces during the Revolutionary War, it was rebuilt but never recovered. By 1813, an elderly Cherokee couple were the only people living at Chota. In 1979, the site was flooded by the creation of Tellico Lake, but Chota was raised above lake level. Archaeologists unearthed the foundation for the Council house, now marked with a monument situated directly above its former location. The remains of 91 Cherokee people were also unearthed, including Oconostota, a well-known Cherokee warrior. Oconostota was reinterred at Chota and the others were reinterred a few miles away at the Sequoyah Birthplace Museum in Vonore, Tennessee.

The town of Chota was an Overhill Cherokee capital in the 1700s. Destroyed in 1780 by American forces during the Revolutionary War, it was rebuilt but never recovered. By 1813, an elderly Cherokee couple were the only people living at Chota. In 1979, the site was flooded by the creation of Tellico Lake, but Chota was raised above lake level. Archaeologists unearthed the foundation for the Council house, now marked with a monument situated directly above its former location. The remains of 91 Cherokee people were also unearthed, including Oconostota, a well-known Cherokee warrior. Oconostota was reinterred at Chota and the others were reinterred a few miles away at the Sequoyah Birthplace Museum in Vonore, Tennessee.

In between serious mosquito attacks, I caught a moment between Dana and Queenie, one of his beloved pups.

Chota was destroyed in 1780 by American forces during the Revolutionary War. After losing possession of the land for about 200 years, Chota is again owned the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians. A memorial at the site honors the Cherokee history of the land, which is now visited by tribal members and the public.

Thirteen years ago, the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians (EBCI) purchased this 70-acre site because it’s home to the historic Cowee Mound and village, thought to date from about 600 A.D. The council house of the Cherokee town of Cowee was located on the mound in the 18th century, when the town served as an important commercial center. In the 1840s, shortly after an estimated 17,000 Cherokee were forced off their homeland by the U.S. government and onto the Trail of Tears, the Halls, a white family, acquired the property. The land remained in the Hall family for 175 years until they returned ownership of it to the Cherokee. The lines covering the mound, in the right of the frame, are likely made from deer walking through the tall grass. Cowee, in fact, roughly translates to “the place of the Deer clan.”

In the Great Smoky Mountains, the EBCI is reclaiming culturally and historically important lands lost during colonization.

He had been working in a tomato farm and experienced a heat stroke that sent him to the hospital. He got out five days later and went back to work. He collapsed in the middle of the day, and did not survive. His body was sent back to his parents in Oaxaca. Emilio, who was 15 at the time, went back with his brother’s body.

The blaze was over 51,000 acres and 2% contained. Above thermal belts, the fire burned actively much of the night and was already spotting past containment lines as of writing. The fire started during a north wind event, and another Red Flag Warning (RFW) starts in 90 minutes for a 31-hour period. I embedded last night with a strike team near Angwin cutting dozer line and protecting homes. The fire behavior was extremely active.

I’m here in Sonoma and Napa counties on assignment covering the Glass Fire impacting wine country and the wine industry itself. This hits close to home as friends yet again are being evacuated and losing structures and businesses for the 3rd time in 4 years, in some cases. The fall harvest is also being adversely affected. Driving past wineries I’ve visited as a tourist and knowing they are gone, I have trouble holding back tears. This all feels incredibly personal.

The fire also impacts the laborers who work in the fields and pick the grapes. With fire closures for safety and a new agricultural permit access system, implementation mid-fire siege is an ongoing issue.

Stay safe out there, have an evacuation plan ready, and follow local emergency alerts.

Franklin was built on top of the town, destroying all but the mound. The council house – the spiritual and political center of Nikwasi town – sat on top of the mound and about 100 houses, a field for playing stickball, a dance ground, and hundreds of acres of crops, orchards, and gardens surrounded it. Since the town of Franklin turned the mound’s grasses brown with herbicide, the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians have been trying to reclaim it. Franklin and now Nikwasi Initiative, who currently owns the deed, have resisted returning the site to the Cherokee. In 2017 the tribe purchased an old auto parts store next to the mound with plans to convert it into a branch of the Museum of the Cherokee Indian.

Time with Amy is always a gift. Before going into the garden, we sat in her truck, drank coffee, and shared stories of being women and mothers. A cultural tradition, Amy’s hair is cut short to symbolize the grief she’s experiencing after losing her youngest daughter to ovarian cancer.

Elephant Nature Park is a place for tourists to learn more about elephants without performances, riding, or other unnatural activities to generate income.

Many camps have expressed that they would be happy to transition, but if and when the demand dictates. In the face of this complex problem, Lek began a movement to change the culture of elephant tourism in Thailand, providing education both to tourists as well as establishing an alliance of camp owners to learn from her experience and begin shifting their own business models towards a more sustainable approach.
Now, due to the collapse of tourism amidst the pandemic, many elephant camps have lost almost their entire source of income.

Breonna was a go-getter, they called her a 'Boss Queen.’ For her age, she had her head on straight. She always lifted people up. Her friends. She was a problem solver, people came to her, they trusted her sense of judgement. She was honest and had integrity. She told you the truth even when you didn't want to hear it…She always felt charged to tell the truth, even in difficult situations, she would always say ‘this is the truth, but what are we going to do to fix it.

Kituwah, also known as the “Cherokee Mother Town,” was the original Cherokee settlement and considered the place of origin for the Cherokee people. This sacred site, which archaeologists date to nearly 10,000 years ago, was reclaimed by the tribe in 1996 after losing ownership of it in the early 1800s. Kituwah Mound, which was located at the center of the village, is still visible today despite nearly 200 years of farming while not under Cherokee ownership.

The blaze is part of the SQF complex, a series of lighting caused fires in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains of California. The fire was increasing in containment and then a weather change caused the fire to explode into massive bark beetle-killed pines, causing the fire to grow. Sadly, homes were lost in the Alpine Drive area and firefighters are working to save houses in the rural and remote Sequoia Crest area, near the Alder Sequoia grove and the 5th largest tree in the world.

There are millions of trees killed by drought and ensuing bark beetle infestations in CA, and the Castle Fire is in part fueled by dead and down trees, living trees that are extremely dry, and dense undergrowth. Heat, drought, and an incredibly strong lightning storm combined with forest management, wildland urban interface construction, and climate change all coalesce on the peaks to create this surreal scene from California’s record setting wildfire siege.

For more than 8 weeks, Stoneman Funeral services and its employees handled almost double the amount of funerals than average;  the funeral home had come close to running out of coffins, and has had to do makeshift storage methods to accommodate the deceased, including clearing out two garages normally used for hearses to accommodate those who passed away with COVID-19 and suspected COVID-19.  Many funeral directors and employees at funeral homes across England have expressed frustration with care homes, hospitals, and mortuaries, which don't always divulge whether a person has passed away with COVID-19 because they are legally not obliged to do so, even though this may put those who work with the deceased at increased risk of exposure. As a result, many funeral directors have been treating every death as if it were COVID+, and don the appropriate PPE while preparing the dead for burial. The United Kingdom was one of the last countries in Europe to decide on a nation-wide lockdown, and it now is suffering one of the worst death rates in the world, with the official government toll at over 41,000 deaths.

Guido Monticelli has been working as an undertaker since 1980. ""What impressed me the most was to see bodies of people who got literally consumed by the disease.""
Fabio Brignoli works in the undertaking business for 10 years. ""It's a stupid thing, it will pass soon, I thought. But at work, we started to see too many deaths, and [...] I started to understand what we were going through. It wasn't just an illness anymore; it transformed into a silent war.""
Roberta Caprini comes from a family of undertakers “The thought that would save me every day was always to try to make a special gesture for the families of the deceased people.""
Roberta Magoni works at Centro Funerario Bergamasco ""Thank God my parents died two years ago, so I was able to tend to them, [...]. I wouldn't have been able to do it if they'd got ill during this time [of COVID-19].""
Enea Rota has worked as an undertaker for almost ten years. ""I don't think I have fully metabolized what has happened in the past month and a half with this virus.”

Fabio Brignoli works in the undertaking business for 10 years. ""It's a stupid thing, it will pass soon, I thought. But at work, we started to see too many deaths, and [...] I started to understand what we were going through. It wasn't just an illness anymore; it transformed into a silent war.""
Roberta Caprini comes from a family of undertakers “The thought that would save me every day was always to try to make a special gesture for the families of the deceased people.""
Roberta Magoni works at Centro Funerario Bergamasco ""Thank God my parents died two years ago, so I was able to tend to them, [...]. I wouldn't have been able to do it if they'd got ill during this time [of COVID-19].""

His younger son Cao Shangfei, 4 months old, was born in midst of the pandemic in China and that urged Cao to come up with a solution. It didn't take long for him to adapt a backpack intended to carry a pet cat or puppy to a fully functional baby pod. The baby pod was fitted with an air purifying system and a device monitoring the air flow and air quality in the pod. After the baby outgrew the baby pod he designed the second edition that is completely 3D printed and features the same air purifying system (pictured here). The inspiration for the first baby pod came from the PlayStation game, Death Stranding. It took him 2 weeks and 6000 yuan ($840usd) to build it. The current 3D printed model took 4 weeks to complete with the same production cost.

Now that the pandemic is under the control in China, Cao is building a device that would help firefighters get in their gear faster and, well, also help him get dressed faster in the mornings.

Robinson was suffering from a cough for several days, a typical symptom of COVID-19. Moghaddam recently returned to work at Henry Ford Hospital after testing positive for COVID-19 on March 29. Moghaddam works with medical students for Detroit Street Care and Street Medicine Detroit.
Moghaddam's family fled religious persecution in Iran and eventually emigrated to Canada in 1984. She has devoted her medical practice to underserved communities, including rural southern Georgia, before returning to Michigan where she teaches at Michigan State University’s medical school and works at Henry Ford Hospital Walk-In Clinics and Urgent Care Centers. ""I went into medicine to save everybody, not just one person,"" Moghaddam said about her work with vulnerable and uninsured populations. ""Because I see people at walk-in clinics my exposure was there."" Many frontline health workers such as Moghaddam have contracted COVID-19.
Out in digital form, the essay and story, Detroit’s winning spirit helps it fight back against COVID-19, documents the disproportionate impact COVID-19 has had on poor residents in Detroit, especially the staggering statistic that African Americans make up 77% of COVID deaths in the city. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has taken action to study the disparities and impact coronavirus has had on African Americans. ""This virus is holding up a mirror to our society, and reminding us of the deep inequities in our country, from basic lack of access to care, to access to transportation, to access to labor protections in the workplace,"" Governor Whitmer said.
While in Detroit, I was inspired by the strength and compassion I witnessed in the face of this crisis. There is not another city in the United States that has endured so much injustice, but still carries a powerful sense of pride and community.

The elephant is caught in sinking mud at the edge of a dam. A herder found it and immediately went to find a community ranger. The ranger notified his control room. Rangers are mobilized with support from the Loisaba conservancy (@loisaba_conservancy) and the Northern Rangelands Trust (@nrt_kenya) including @kieran.avery whose work I’ve been documenting this past week. He’s the one seen here digging it out. The elephant, now exhausted and severely dehydrated, is part dug, part dragged out of the mud that would surely have been his grave. Having been washed down it got up, gave itself a good shake and wandered off for a spot of browsing. The point here for me is not only that the elephant is now alive and well, but also more importantly, that all these organizations, although operating in extraordinarily remote parts of Kenya, are able to communicate, plan, support, and action the rescue and continued long life of this incredible creature. This has been a Herculean task to get to this point. The point, my point, is that it takes money to do this, and to maintain the infrastructure to support it. Without income from tourism in this part of the world this is going to get increasingly difficult to replicate. We all bang on about what will happen if tourism doesn’t return.

This time, due to the economic impact of COVID-19 outbreak, many people have started their journey much earlier, even before Ramadan began. Pictured here are passengers on an intercity bus from Jakarta to Padang, a city on the west coast of Sumatra. The journey will take at least 40 hours, and due to high demand the bus company largely ignored the government’s rule to leave half the vehicle empty.

He is in a modified quarantine because he came in contact with someone in the White House that tested positive for COVID-19. Fauci, the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has become the scientific face of America’s COVID-19 response, and he said in our exclusive interview the best evidence shows the virus behind the pandemic was not made in a lab in China. He shot down the discussion that has been raging among politicians and pundits, calling it “a circular argument” in a conversation.

This last week, I spent time in Biliqo Bulesa Community Conservancy documenting some of the work and projects of the Northern Rangelands Trust @nrt_kenya. This is part of a larger story looking at how the downturn in tourism due to #covid19 will affect communities across northern Kenya. As a community led organization, they are seeing the impact of the pandemic across 42,000 sq kilometers of indigenous lands. I spent time with nursing officer Madina Kalo, who is employed by the Kenya government, seen here with Ramadan, who she delivered safely into the hands of his mother Hadija Galma. Madina is the lifeline that the entire population here rely upon; she is supported by volunteer community health officers who are currently employed informing the population about how to avoid COVID-19. However, life goes on here and during the time I spent with her, working from a tiny surgery room, attached to an even smaller delivery room, she dealt with malaria, fever (non-COVID related) coughs, colds, severed fingers, pregnancies, family planning, prenatal, and post-natal issues. She will shortly move into a slightly larger clinic, built by @nrt_kenya; it’s not grand, and definitely not well equipped but I’m certain she’ll fill it with the love and human spirit that has already burst the walls on the existing one. Difficult times ahead for all of us, but please do consider these communities who rely on the support of others, whether through tourism, or funding, both of which are becoming increasingly difficult to find.

Some owners say they wish the government would issue a strict lockdown so they could be eligible for federal assistance. The government started a ban on gatherings of more than 50 people. That rule however does not apply to bars and restaurants which would still be crowded with fewer people. Their restriction is to make sure groups of patrons stay an arms length apart, but people can still gather together around one table.

He’s roughly 1.5 months old and a very new member of the nursery herd at Reteti @r.e.s.c.u.e where all are under 6 months old. The Reteti Elephant Sanctuary is situated on Namunyak Community Conservancy @nrt_kenya in the remote Mathews Range, among Kenya’s second largest elephant population. Orphan elephants arrive here for a multitude of different reasons; for example, simply losing their family as the herd moves off, or in this case, falling into a well whilst drinking and being unable to escape the hyenas which discovered him later that night and attacked him, resulting in the loss of his trunk. It is estimated that between five and ten elephant calves are rescued in northern Kenya each year, from a population of roughly 8700. Those received by the sanctuary are cared for by community members such as the amazing Mary, then returned to the wild. I’ll be following the story of Long’uro over the next weeks as I work with the community here who hope not to have to experience COVID-19. This little guy will have his own battles to fight.

Last year, after finishing school, they moved from their hometown in West Sumatra to realize their dream working in Jakarta. But the worsening COVID-19 outbreak has forced them to go back since their places of work have closed and high cost of living became unbearable. They were able to secure two tickets and traveled on an intercity bus just two days before the Indonesian government put a strict measure in order to prevent people moving out of Jakarta.

City life is expensive and in the absence of work they would not be able to sustain. Thus started a journey, in some cases, a thousand kilometers long. In the absence of trains, people started to walk, bicycle, or hitch hike carrying only the essentials to get to their villages. Here, people wait on a highway looking for their next mode of transportation.

As someone who has spent decades photographing the city I love so deeply, I recognized that this moment in New York City will become an important part of our collective history.

With the generous support of @natgeo, I embarked on an assignment to document New York City from above in this moment in time. I wanted to capture the city skyline aglow in sunset light. Because of this pandemic, the city was on fire. The city’s newest additions to the skyline a glow in hot light, looking like a thermometer with an extreme fever.
This is the first image from a series that I’ll be sharing from this project. It’s one of my favorites, because it was in my mind’s eye, before I ever saw it.

Father Vasilios approached me and my assistant as we were wrapping up after a long day of installing and testing 4 stand-alone cameras in the Holy Sepulchre Church in Jerusalem and mentioned he is in charge of lighting all
the lamps on and inside the Edicule every day. As tired as we were, I spent another half hour enchanted by his meditative and meticulous personal daily ceremony. Yesterday he lit the lamps with the Holy Fire, said to materialize above the tomb of Jesus. Check out our story about the ancient Holy Fire Ceremony taking place in Jerusalem despite the coronavirus pandemic.

The mass confinement imposed by the need to prevent coronavirus from spreading has helped new forms of sociality to rise.
Every night, at 6 pm, people reach for their windows and start playing an instrument or music on a loudspeaker, loud enough for everybody on the street to hear. In a few days, it has become a regular appointment, engaging people of all ages and kinds.
In this picture, Via Vigevano neighborhood, in the heart of Milan, a district well known for its “movida”, during a 6 pm party.
