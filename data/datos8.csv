,,,,,,"Photos by @jenguyton | Cyclone Freddy, which made landfall in Mozambique for the second time last Saturday, is shattering records for the longest lasting and most energetic storm. Freddy has killed dozens of people in Mozambique and Malawi.

Climate change intensifies such weather events the world over. These images are from another record-busting storm, Cyclone Idai. On March 15, 2019, it made landfall in Beira, Mozambique, and claimed more than 1,300 people, making it one of the deadliest storms on record in the Southern Hemisphere. Thousands were displaced when their homes collapsed or flooded; many lived in Gorongosa National Park’s adjacent buffer zone.

Park staff put their usual work on hold to respond to the crisis. Before the major aid agencies had organized relief, rangers began to fly food and supplies to communities that had been cut off by floodwaters from the outside world, their crops and food stores destroyed.

I made these images while riding along with relief teams in the park's buffer zone. Joana Vitor (above) went into labor in the midst of the cyclone. As her house fell around her, she gave birth, alone and unaided. Here, baby Teresa is three weeks old and healthy. Behind them, a park helicopter arrives with emergency supplies. In the other images: people await food distribution in the Bebedo community, and others bring food parcels home in a community called Machongo Barada.",24.793 Me gusta,2023-03-15T13:01:21.000Z,https://scontent-mad2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/335936523_782245003332471_8451598338803728655_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-mad2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=D0A6JvZSLJUAX_Tz99r&edm=ACWDqb8BAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzA1OTAzMzMxNzkxNzU1MDczMg%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfDaFEtxl67m8l_3u-6a73KQ5t9w1riAyrEDEN0UoE1fIQ&oe=64162F90&_nc_sid=1527a3,imagenpreubaH1-1.jpg,"Photo by National Geographic on March 15, 2023.

,,,,,,"Photos by Eduard Florin Niga @eduardflorinnigaphotography | Ants are my absolute favorite subject to photograph. I find myself browsing endlessly through my galleries of ants, and I realize that I may sometimes forget the names of some of the species I imaged over the years, but I always remember how I felt when I created each photograph. Each time I relive a mixture of childlike curiosity, excitement, bewilderment, joy, and that secret feeling you get when you know you've experienced something very few may have.

What attracted me to ants in the first place was the discovery of how varied their ""faces"" are. The variation in color, size, shape, morphology, and texture is just extraordinary, and I'm convinced I will continue to be surprised by this for a very long time.

The process of imaging each of these tiny yet mighty beauties is hardly ever an easy one. Every ""portrait"" I create takes me a lot of time, patience (which I was told I lack), and hundreds and hundreds of carefully planned and expertly executed images that I then merge into the final frame I share with the big world. It involves countless sleepless nights, as I mainly work at night at the back of my house in a dimly lit, silent, vibration-free environment, an environment I imagine being very similar to an underground ants’ nest. Is it easy? No, not by any stretch of the imagination. But it is extremely rewarding, and the satisfaction I get from sharing these with the world and creating awareness out there is fANTastic. The only regret I have is not starting this adventure sooner.

,,,,,,"Photos by @richardbarnes | Since 2019 I've been photographing for a National Geographic story on the repatriation of objects from European and North American museums to the countries that originally created them. For many years now I've been involved in photography in and around museum collections across the globe. I'm interested in how nations or peoples define themselves through their collections and how those collections were obtained, curated, and put on display.

Colonial powers acquired (some would say stole) sacred objects and historical artifacts from African nations as well as from North American Indian tribes for the better part of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Recently, curators, museum directors, politicians, and others have advocated a return of these objects to their ""rightful"" owners, primarily in African nations. I've photographed in Cameroon, Nigeria, Benin, and Kenya, as well as in numerous European and North American museums where these objects have been housed for decades. It's a complex and nuanced story: In many instances it's unclear if the objects that ended up in European and American museums were legally obtained, ""gifted,"" or stolen. In some cases—as with the thousands of Benin Bronzes, which were looted by the British in a punitive raid of 1897—it's clear, but in others it's open to interpretation and not so definitive as to how the objects found their way into European and North American collections.

,,,,,,"Photo by @jasperdoest | An Anatolian leopard, an endangered species native to the Iranian plateau whose territory spans more than 40 square kilometers (15 sq mi), now inhabits a small zoo enclosure in Duhok, Iraq. This animal, with an estimated wild population of only a thousand, lost one of its hind legs after getting caught in a wolf trap placed by mountain shepherds trying to protect their herds.

Despite the IUCN’s recommendation that the leopard be relocated to a larger facility in Europe as part of a breeding program, the government has deemed it the property of Iraq, and the animal has been unable to receive the resources it needs for full rehabilitation. The leopard’s growl of distress speaks volumes—a heartbreaking reminder of the consequences of human intervention and the urgent need to protect the dwindling population of threatened species.

Among them are the Kurdish Iraqi college students I photographed in 2015 in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq; they wouldn’t quit playing basketball despite war raging all around them. With the Islamic State attacking and seizing large swaths of land in Iraq, people were fleeing for their lives. It was a dangerous time for women—especially for Christians, Yazidis, and Kurds—who were frequently kidnapped and killed by insurgents. The young women who attended the American University of Iraq in Sulaymaniyah not only kept going to school, but they also refused to give up the sport. Many of them are now in their 30s and have children of their own. It was heartening to spend time with them nearly a decade ago, on and off the court, as they figured out who they wanted to be and what they stood for.

""Even though the discrimination against Indigenous people in Bolívia is huge, I believe that wearing a pollera to skateboard identifies myself with my roots,"" she says. It's empowering for the group, which aspires to attract more women to the sport and tackle stereotypes.

Teffy stands on the city's San Pedro hill. ""When you look at this view,"" she says, ""you see that nature thrives here and that not all is lost because of technological developments and population growth—and the most important of all, I'm proud of being K'ochala.""

Baarud, which means ""tough"" in Somali, was given the name because its mother nearly died in a drought while it was in utero. To save her, Aadara divided her own meager rations and nursed the camel back to life. As the region once again endures a horrific drought–the worst in recorded history–it feels vital to reflect on the intimate connection among people, their animals, and the land.

,,,,,,"Photo by @tasneemalsultan | With the recent earthquakes, my thoughts turned again to the plight of Syrian refugees and how these events exacerbate their tenuous situation. This photo of a Syrian refugee was taken in Amman, Jordan, in 2016.

""I've stopped going to school for a few months now. I want to keep attending but the boys here harass me, asking me to sell myself since I'm a Syrian girl. They keep saying that pretty Syrian girls get a lot of money."" I was walking with the 14-year-old through a graveyard. ""We were never harassed back home,"" she continued. ""But Syria is gone.""

I saw so much devastation in the young eyes of these beautiful souls. I had never witnessed such love for a nation or land. A 10- year-old wrote a poem, a 15-year-old made a collage, and a 7-year-old created a photo essay, all focused on the loss of their beloved Syria, a place now further traumatized and forgotten.

Was Syria ideal? Or do we miss only what we can't ever get back? As we exchanged hugs and tears, I realized the strongest souls are the ones that keep smiling.

This and another mummy, KV21A, were found in the KV21 tomb located in the Valley of the Kings. Discovered by Italian archaeologist and explorer Giovanni Belzoni in 1817, the tomb was later re-excavated by American archaeologist Donald P. Ryan in the 1980s. Some Egyptologists think KV21A and KV21B might be 18th dynasty queens, so further analysis of DNA samples and CT scans are being conducted to determine the mummies’ origins and family tree. Egyptian archaeologists such as Zahi Hawass consider KV21B a candidate for the body of Nefertiti.

The country’s deterioration has been rapid and painful. A severe economic crisis in 2019 caused more than half the population of a once middle-income nation to plunge into poverty within the span of a year or so. The arrival of COVID-19 worsened already desperate conditions. The Lebanese are a study in resilience but also of multigenerational trauma. In the March issue, an essay from Lebanese writer Rania Abouzeid examines the country’s breakdown and how the 2020 Beirut port explosion was its gravest manifestation. From the rich and aristocratic to the low income, all Lebanese are grappling with a confluence of crises—financial, security, and political.

(1) A group of women explores a fort known as the Sea Castle, built in the 13th century by the Crusaders, on the coastline of Sidon, Lebanon’s third largest city. Archaeological sites are found all along the ancient land’s shore.

(2) On August 4, 2020, an explosion at a Port of Beirut warehouse storing ammonium nitrate killed at least 218 people, injured thousands, and destroyed more than 85,000 properties. These grain silos absorbed some of the blast’s impact, shielding part of the capital from widespread damage.

(3) Ralph Mellehe’s family weeps over his coffin. Mellehe was part of a 10-person firefighting team dispatched to put out the blaze.

(4) In Batroun, modern restaurants and clubs exist alongside ancient ruins and historic churches.

(5) Hady Fowal, 12, joined a group of men who set up a roadblock of burning tires in March 2021 on the main highway to Tripoli as a protest of Lebanon’s deteriorating economic conditions.

(6) Lebanese relax in seawater pools at a beach resort in Chekka on the northern coast in September 2019. A month later, the nation’s economy crumbled.

“I learned later on in life that I was Native. My parents didn’t tell us, because back in the day—my grandparents’ generation—it was even worse to be Native than it was to be Black in Southern California. Natives weren't allowed in town; we had bounties on our heads. A lot of Natives transferred over to the Spanish side [Mexico]. They went across the border and portrayed themselves as Mexicans—that way they could go into town and buy things and not be killed, in other words.""

,,,,,,"Photos by @babaktafreshi | I have peaceful memories of this 2010 evening in a Kurdish village in Iran, including a group of curious children following me around while I photographed the cultural landscape of Hawraman, a World Heritage site.

Today Kurdish cities are the beating heart of protests against the Islamic Republic of Iran and its brutal treatment toward unarmed protesters. The uprising was triggered last September by the death of Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish woman who died in police custody. Protesters have embraced the slogan “Woman, Life, Freedom,” which has roots in female militias fighting against ISIS.

Today Kurdish cities are the beating heart of protests against the Islamic Republic of Iran and its brutal treatment toward unarmed protesters. The uprising was triggered last September by the death of Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish woman who died in police custody. Protesters have embraced the slogan “Woman, Life, Freedom,” which has roots in female militias fighting against ISIS.

Akkök plays the flute for his beloved animals in his living room, a place of solace and comfort for the 70+ strays he has welcomed and rescued on his farm just south of Istanbul. He joined a growing number of city dwellers moving to the countryside, where he cares for his four-legged friends. His blind horse, Reyhan, is drawn to the mellow sounds of the music and has even damaged his saxophone in her enthusiasm.

Through it all, Akkök's door remains open, providing his furry family with a safe haven. “We enjoy each other's company,” he says. “They're like my kids now, and I would only give them to decent and good people who can take very good care of them.”

Although the species is common in some areas, there is little data about it. A recent study that called the frog ""an underexplored source of bioactive peptides"" found three new antimicrobial peptide families in the skin secretions of the frog—a reminder that we must protect its habitat. As we bring many animals to extinction, we are destroying opportunities to find cures for diseases such as cancer and to discover new antibiotics for multiresistant bacteria among other substances.

Crafted from mud and designed to allow for ventilation, the houses are then finished with coats of decorative paint that protect the dwellings from the rain. Despite the local king’s determination to preserve traditional ways of home construction, most locals have moved outside the royal court, or compound, in order to be able to build with concrete or in other nontraditional ways. There is a popular perception that concrete equates to modernity and that earth bricks are a symbol of poverty and backwardness. In addition, some local Christian and Muslim clerics see traditional architecture as an extension of animist beliefs, so they advise residents against living in mud-brick homes after they have converted to Christianity or Islam. NGOs and community elders are pushing back, hoping that cultural and ethnic identity will persuade some families to reembrace their cultural architecture tradition.

In these images: The volcano rises more than 3,000 feet (900 m).

The Australis, a 75-foot steel-hulled vessel, supported the team throughout the monthlong expedition. Guide Carla Perez looks out from its bow. Traveling against the prevailing winds, the return journey from Saunders Island lasted nearly two weeks.

The team steals a quick rest 300 feet below the summit during the ascent. The combination of humidity and wind caused rime, or bits of granular ice, to quickly form on clothing and equipment, making hypothermia a constant risk.

As gusts pummel her tent, volcanologist Emma Nicholson carefully melts each snow sample and adds a chemical agent to preserve the composition for study back home in the lab.

,,,,,,"Photo by @richardbarnes | I have been photographing a National Geographic story on repatriation for the past 3 years. Repatriation concerns the return of objects mostly from European and American museums to the countries or peoples that originally produced them. Some of the artifacts were given under duress, and others were looted outright, but still others, such as the Nefertiti bust, now in the Neues Museum in Berlin, may have been obtained legally. It's no secret that colonial powers were rapacious in the theft of objects sacred to the people who created them—from the Benin Bronzes looted in a British raid in 1897 to the Mandu Yenu throne, whose return the Bamun kings in Cameroon have been seeking for decades. It's a complicated and nuanced debate: Some former colonial powers, along with museums including the Smithsonian Institution, embrace return or transfer of control, and others justify their position by claiming that many of the objects in their collections would never have been preserved if it were not for a globe-trotting curator or colonial overlord who recognized their value and saved them from neglect or ruin. Nonetheless, I have witnessed a sea change since I started this project, with many museum directors, curators, and concerned government officials advocating for return in as conscientious and equitable a way as possible. It's never too late.

,,,,,,"Photos by @nadiashiracohen | Eight months ago, I seemingly released effortlessly the dock lines of our 50-foot catamaran, Takaroa (""sea god"" in Maori), from its berth just outside of Rome. As we set off to circumnavigate the globe for three years, I knew nothing about sailing—only that boats made me queasy. Now my husband (an experienced sailor) and I trade off two-hour night watches on long passages. Nights blur into days—days we tend to lose track of, along with time zones. We homeschool our two children, Rafael and Olivia, although books seem futile compared to the experience of living in symbiosis with nature. After years of realizing carefully researched stories, my camera is now turned both inward and outward, dictated by the course of our exploration.

In August we stopped over at Mindelo, Cape Verde (above), where a tugboat stranded during rough weather in 2011 has been slowly sinking into the bay. It's costly to dispose of wrecks, so abandoned boats both small and large litter the islands of Cape Verde.

In January, near Port Williams, Chile, we rescued a baby duck that seemed lost. We scooped it up, offering water and bread. When it had built up its strength and began quacking, we set it out on the deck so that its mother might hear it. Sure enough, shortly thereafter, she passed by and the family was reunited.

In November, while docked at Mar del Plata, Argentina, Rafael looks out at a sea lion from his bedroom hatch.

In Punta del Este, Uruguay, a bird and a sea lion near a fish market await scraps.

In Barra Grande, Brazil, on October 3, Olivia roasts marshmallows at a beach in Bahia reachable only by boat—and therefore deserted.

In Patagonia, Argentina, Perito Moreno, one of the few advancing glaciers in the world, constantly calves ice. On a December morning, we witnessed several spectacular chunks fall into the water, followed by loud cracking noises and reverberating waves.

Spider egg sacs are multilayered and complex structures that physically protect the eggs and hatchlings against predators and parasitoids, as well as changing temperatures. Here you can see some examples that I photographed in the Ecuadorian Amazon.

Suspended by a thread of silk, a thorned heart orb weaver spider (Micrathena clypeata) builds her egg case in the Amazon rainforest near Tena, Ecuador.

A female orb weaver spider (Rubrepeira rubronigra) takes care of an egg sac among the vegetation near Tena, Ecuador.

A female orb weaver spider (Micrathena kirbyi) constructs an egg sac over a leaf in Yasuní, Ecuador.

""My whole family lives on the reservation. My brother has danced all his life; my mom was a shaman, a medicine woman. In '03 my brother comes to me and says, 'Fill out this paperwork for eagle feathers.’ I am going, ‘what?’ I had shunned the Native life; I was a businessman living in faraway California. I had been the CEO of two companies, but still I gave the order and sent it to the fish and game department in Colorado. Three years later, a big box showed up with dry ice and I pulled out a frozen bald eagle.

So I started plucking the feathers and at night I start dreaming of dancing with the Old Ones. One morning I woke up, I saw face paint on me and a badger on my head. I turned to my wife and said, 'I want to start dancing.'""

Edwards's passage refers to the ability of Native Americans to apply to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for access to eagle carcasses, parts, and feathers, which are used for ceremonial or religious purposes.

Thank you Percy Edwards for your words and time.

A physiotherapy student, Belén would like to match her career choice to her passion. She started skateboarding 4 years ago because she was amazed by the balance skills and the level of difficulty of the maneuvers. She'd like to use her knowledge as a physiotherapist to help skateboarders.

""Imilla"" means ""girl"" or ""young lady"" in Quechua and Aymara, the most widely spoken Native languages in Bolivia.
“We want to motivate the female skateboarding scenario in Bolivia so this sport can grow and we can get more spaces to practice—so we can participate in sports tournaments around the world as other athletes do,"" says one member of the skating group. ""Another thing we want to do is to show that no matter how you look, how old you are, or what’s your gender, you can be part of the skate community and feel the freedom of skateboarding. We believe that everyone deserves respect, and we must get rid of discrimination and mistreatment towards people who are different from you. Diversity makes beauty.”

It wasn’t until the 1960s, when highways were built and snowmobiles became widespread, that dogs were no longer needed for transport.

The Maasai had been grazing their cattle inside the reserve in day and night shifts, bringing them into regular contact with the local lions. The result was a strange relationship: the lions developed strategies to hunt the cattle, mainly at night, and the Maasai learned to avoid them by texting each other the locations of the lions. It was exhilarating and terrifying to photograph—on foot—at night, and I was amazed by the bravery of the guys, who would run right up to the lions, throwing stones to scare them off. The lions would usually stand their ground, growling aggressively, and although they do occasionally attack, I never witnessed it.",69.460 Me gusta,2023-02-21T17:00:12.000Z,https://scontent-mad2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/332254508_1371573656938701_5556402779876845157_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-mad2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=Z2OdsotMAIMAX_h2pe8&edm=ABmJApABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzA0MzIwOTAxMzQ4NzQzNDgyOQ%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfCxhToDH90Qa5PeUldx5PLKyTJuAa-0C-ioKq9EiYia4w&oe=6416856A&_nc_sid=6136e7,imagenpreubaH92-1.jpg,"Photo by National Geographic on February 21, 2023.

The bird's ""umbrella"" method (also known as canopy feeding) involves spreading out those dark wings to create a shadowy trap for unsuspecting prey. Drawn in by the illusion of a shady hideaway, fish are soon dispatched by a few flicks of the heron's beak.

,,,,,,"Photo by @moisessaman | Four-year-old Alloua Anooga lies on a traditional mud-brick wall at his family’s home in Tiebele, Burkina Faso. The village has some of the best preserved remaining examples of traditional painted Burkinabe architecture.

Crafted from mud and designed to allow for ventilation, the houses are then finished with coats of decorative paint that protect the dwellings from the rain. Despite the local king’s determination to preserve traditional ways of home construction, most locals have moved outside the royal court, or compound, in order to be able to build with concrete or in other nontraditional ways. There is a popular perception that concrete equates to modernity and that earth bricks are a symbol of poverty and backwardness. In addition, some local Christian and Muslim clerics see traditional architecture as an extension of animist beliefs, so they advise residents against living in mud-brick homes after they have converted to Christianity or Islam. NGOs and community elders are pushing back, hoping that cultural and ethnic identity will persuade some families to reembrace their cultural architecture tradition.

And I'm doing that with electrons instead of light because they're smaller than a speck of dust. For this project, I've had the incredible fortune to use the world's smallest scanning electron microscope (SEM) to photograph radiolarians in my own backyard for several months now. After 150 hours of scanning, I ended up with some unique images! Each individual image is made from 20 to 60 images shot in a grid stitched together.

These skeletons help scientists study global warming because their chemical signatures can tell us about ocean health back through millions of years. I'd seen images of radiolarians many times, but they were almost always perfect and singular scientific specimens. For this ongoing body of work, I'm focusing on making images that are more poetic than scientific, searching for radiolarians that were locked in an embrace or dance by the chance connection of some parts of their spines, which happened millions of years after their death. Most SEM devices are quite large, but this one is portable and a first of its kind. It's the size of a toaster and was made to travel—even ending up on the International Space Station at one point!

Brenda and her mother are Indigenous Aymara and considered to be pollera women because of the colorful traditional skirts—polleras—they wear. Brenda started skateboarding 6 years ago and found that it gave her direction and helped her overcome fear. ""It makes me feel capable because I can break my own limits and I can dare to do things that I have never thought about,"" she says. ""And like this I can get over my daily fear.""

It's very hard to skateboard wearing a voluminous skirt, but Brenda has been improving her skills through perseverance and practice. For her, skateboarding with ImillaSkate represents her roots, the place she comes from, and who she is.

,,,,,,"Photo by @yagazieemezi | When I was asked to choose an image to tie to Valentine’s Day, I pondered which one could hold all the meanings we often place on the day. Then I remembered this 2018 portrait of Shari, Kobby, and their son in Accra, Ghana. It was a favorite photographic moment for me—I had the joy of being welcomed into it. They've since divorced but happily co-parent. I reached out to them for their permission to once again share the sweet family scene along with their feelings about it. Here's what they said:

""It was such a profoundly tender picture. We had friends and family reach out for weeks after it first went online, either complimenting us or telling us they would never have shared such an intimate shot. We wanted to blow it up, frame it, and hang it over our bed. It captured something of what we wanted our family to be.

Much has changed since then. Yet thankfully some things have not. It remains crucial to us both that he continues to know what love looks like; that he still feels as safe and as held as he was in the picture. And that starts with how we treat him and each other—with respect and kindness, patience and genuine care. We want him to know that love isn't just roses and Valentine's Day cards. Sometimes, it's messy, hard-won, and unconventional. But we too are what love looks like. And we're very proud of that.""",168.093 Me gusta,2023-02-14T20:00:24.000Z,https://scontent-mad2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/330856751_1608928569556487_5882725772023170932_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-mad2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=1q6m9-1KBi4AX8b8smb&edm=ABmJApABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzAzODIyNjI5MTA0OTE2MTA4NQ%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfCU7w2cEDjDPfPuTDKASCGz_KpZFNOKYASunU_P6hpxNA&oe=6417DF2F&_nc_sid=6136e7,imagenpreubaH124-1.jpg,"Photo by National Geographic on February 14, 2023.

A couple of years later, we decided that we loved each other and wanted to be together,” says Evelyn Jenkins Whitaker (at right). She and her wife, Sonja Jackson, have been together for 18 years. Their families, they say, have “embraced us.”

For six years, in 14 countries, I recorded stories from LGBTQ folks for my project Where Love Is Illegal. Sadly, not all families are as accepting as Evelyn and Sonja’s. Many people told me it was their relatives whose discrimination was the most intense and most damaging. With each Valentine’s Day, it is my hope that we move closer toward recognizing that love is love—nothing else should matter.

,,,,,,"Photo by @jasperdoest | We know kissing as a greeting and as a way of expressing love, desire, and respect. But what about monkeys? Do they also kiss?

Yes. Some species, such as macaques and baboons, will often make communication gestures known as lip-smacking, which can lead to contact with the lips. It usually occurs between adult female monkeys and their young infants.

Aside from kissing, monkeys will hug and groom each other. Grooming is a way to show affection and respect. It helps to reduce tension by lowering the heart rate and releasing endorphins, the ""feel-good"" hormones.

Take the nose, for example. Large nostrils and a broad nasal cavity make it easier for the snow leopard to inhale large amounts of oxygen-poor mountain air. The nasal cavity houses particularly large and thick mazes of bone and tissue called turbinates. When a snow leopard inhales freezing air into the turbinates, the air becomes heated as it mixes with warm air exiting the lungs. Now that's an incredible life hack that evolution has provided to these big cats.

The center, using a process that includes insemination and embryo transfers, aims to create genetically “improved” alpacas that offer higher fiber quality and are more resilient to disease and the effects of climate change. Indigenous communities often raise money to buy one of these specimens to add to their livestock. Tens of thousands of families depend on alpacas for their livelihoods, but climate change poses a growing risk to the animals and the communities they sustain. The Andes are experiencing shorter but more intense rainy seasons and longer periods of drought. Frosts and hailstorms have become more common. Changing weather patterns are shrinking natural pastures and reducing grass quality, forcing alpaca herds to compete for food.

,,,,,,"Photo by David Chancellor @chancellordavid | I’ve spoken before about my work documenting the rewilding of Saudi Arabia and the Arabian leopard as a powerful symbol of restoration and regeneration. I’ve spent days and days sitting calmly, waiting and watching these magnificent creatures. Although it can be frustrating (I’m not a patient person), I’m extremely happy to find that my work is becoming more difficult, more complex, with the arrival of each new cub. Here, we see the latest one.

Born at the Arabian leopard breeding center in Taif, Saudi Arabia, these apex predators will one day be released back into this ecosystem. The center is operated by the Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU). This winter, RCU is releasing more than 1,500 Arabian gazelles, sand gazelles, Arabian oryx, and Nubian ibex into their ancestral habitat. The last piece of the puzzle will be the return of the Arabian leopard. Before that happens, the land will need to be re-greened to support the prey, as the pyramid of a functioning ecosystem rises from the desert sand. One day, this leopard will sit in these mountains and watch from a great distance as people walk by, unaware of its presence. Until then, the longer it takes for me to see it here, the better its chances of survival are in the wild.

Today, February 10, marks the second Arabian Leopard Day, which sheds light on the plight of this majestic creature and the conservation work under way to ensure its survival.

But this photograph tells only one part of their story. In 2011 Will was evicted from a retirement community where he shared an apartment with Adina, a longtime companion. He moved into another assisted-living community nearby, where he met Jeanie. They connected immediately. Torn between Adina and Jeanie, Will tried to maintain a relationship with both. Eventually, after a period of discomfort, conflict, and uncertainty, Jeanie and Adina accepted the unconventional dynamic. “There are many different kinds of love,” said Adina. Jeanie, Will, and Adina formed a trio, often spending days roaming around the east side of Los Angeles. Their relationship challenged sociocultural norms and stereotypes about how older adults should live their lives. More than anything, their time together revealed ageless questions about freedom, romantic love, the nature of intimacy, and what constitutes a relationship.

“Emory made a difference in how we see the sea,” says David Doubilet, a fellow photographer who collaborated on stories with Kristof for decades. “I covered the first 200 feet [60m] of depth, and he took the rest. And the rest was thousands of feet beneath our hull.”

Kristof pushed the technical boundaries of photography and was a pioneer of using submersibles to show parts of the world previously unknown, including deep-sea vents. “Emory tried to convince everyone he worked with that his current project was not only worthwhile but groundbreaking. And he was usually correct,” says former director of photography Kent Kobersteen. “His dedication to photography was unparalleled. He truly lived and breathed his projects.”

Kristof regularly contributed to the magazine from 1963 to 1994.

“He stood tall as a pioneer of the deep and now others stand on his shoulders to reach farther, or in this case, deeper—as it should be,” says @daviddoubilet.

One possible theory could be that due to its high elevation, this cave carries cooler winds throughout the year and never really gets warm enough to melt the ice. It's over 500 meters (1,650 ft) higher than Schwarzmooskogel, which is melting fast.

The different strategies are developed and implemented by communities, neighborhoods, hamlets, and others, according to their specific needs, and enable Japanese to lead their lives in harmony with their values.

(1) Toyama, a city on Japan’s largest island, has striven to become a more hospitable place to grow old. One key initiative is the Kadokawa Preventive Care Center, which has exercise pools fed by hot springs. Every day about 250 older adults work out at the facility.

(2) In Japan, population decline and aging in rural areas are progressing rapidly. It is estimated that about 500 hamlets will disappear in the next 10 years, and this erosion will accelerate in the future. Toshie Ueno, 91, the last resident of a hamlet on Shikoku Island, feeds her cats just outside of her home.

(3) Hiromu Inada, 89, became the oldest triathlete ever to complete an Ironman World Championship in 2018. He started swimming at 60 after he retired and participated in his first triathlon when he was 70. He trains daily.

(4) Osamu Yamanaka, a 67-year-old physician, visits Kiichi Takahashi, 74, in his room in Kotobukicho, an area of Yokohama that is home to day laborers. Today there are about 120 small cheap lodging apartment buildings designated for older welfare recipients. Yamanaka runs a clinic in Kotobuchiko and helps his patients during their last stages of life.

(5) Genyu Daito, 64, the chief priest of Banshoji, a Buddhist temple in Nagoya, prays in a LED-lit ossuary that highlights niches when they are selected by an electronic ID card. Innovative burial options are becoming popular as the tradition of family tombs declines.

Huge reductions in their natural habitat are among the threats that have pushed the number of adult cheetahs globally to around just 7,000. The fight against the newest threat—rampant trafficking, with cheetahs being sold over social media—is being waged in an unexpected place: Somaliland, a resource-poor, self-declared autonomous republic in the Horn of Africa. Central to its efforts is the legal front, where many are pushing to increase jail sentences for traffickers. These five cubs were shown to a judge as evidence during the trial of an infamous trafficker. Moving wild animals like cheetahs to safety is a dangerous undertaking, as it requires maintaining the animal's safety and care throughout the journey.

,,,,,,"Photos by @kiliiiyuyan | These portraits document a group of 21st-century ""wildlings"" from North America and Europe as they rediscover the primitive living skills of the Paleolithic. The Living Wild movement, spearheaded by a British expat named Lynx Vilden (on horseback), looks to change what is known as short-term wilderness survival into long-term wilderness thriving. I took these portraits with a portable backdrop shortly before heading out on a month-long excursion into the high-mountain wilderness of central Washington State—where the only material items allowed would be ones made using entirely natural materials and methods before the age of metal.

These immersion courses, where I've worked as a guest instructor, draw on hunter-gatherer methods. Today Vilden is based out of northern Norway, where participants learn how to make tools from stone or wood, use friction fire, tan hides, hunt and process meat, and gather edible berries among other activities—without any fallbacks to post-agricultural technologies. Some attendees want a deeper relationship to the landscape they live in; others seek personal alternatives to the capitalism that has taken over much of the world culturally.

It's not without controversy, as some view the movement as Indigenous appropriation. I hope both Vilden and the Indigenous peoples who hold the movement accountable will pave the way for a clearer understanding of the morality around it—and that it might bring us all closer to the land once again. Follow me for more on the human relationship with land.

,,,,,,"Photos by @jasperdoest | Meeting Teun Toebes (center) on assignment last year opened my eyes to the selfless, compassionate care he provides for the residents of a nursing home for adults with dementia. At only 23 years old, Toebes has been living rent free at the nursing home for more than two years, providing companionship and joy to his housemates, who are often over 50 years his senior.

Toebes’s goal is not to live the life of his housemates—that’s not possible given the age difference—but rather to contribute to dementia care in his own way. He often organizes activities, such as camping in the home’s garden. His focus on maintaining personal contact creates moments of happiness and thereby improves quality of life. “The memories my housemates have of me are based on love and friendship and not on rational memories, such as my name,” says Toebes. Recently, he moved to another nursing home because he felt that all his friends had passed away within a year or two. “People in nursing homes lead an isolated life, which makes them ill. I try to make a difference from within these homes,” he explains.

“Everyone should be entitled to an equal and inclusive society that is not diminished due to a single medical diagnosis,” he continues. “To combat the stigma often associated with dementia, it is essential to view people with this condition as human beings rather than a burden on society. Only when we recognize the individual’s humanity will they never be forgotten.”

It's an experiment to test whether underwater greenhouses could be an agricultural option for arid coastal countries that must put resources into desalinating water for crops.

Each dome has a platform that allows divers to partially enter the shell (as seen in the foreground). Plant cultivation is based on the hydroponic technique, whereby soil is replaced by a substrate that contains the nutrients and minerals needed for plant growth. As sunlight penetrates the humid domes, it leads to further condensation, generating the water source for the plants. Since no pests can penetrate the environment, it also doesn't require the use of chemical pesticides.

A sea otter pup (second slide) searches for food in a giant kelp forest in Monterey Bay. Sea otters will generally dive down the vertical stipe (like a trunk on a terrestrial tree) and look for crabs and snails before they reach the ocean floor. Once there, they'll search for octopuses, clams, and urchins.

In the last frame, a female sea otter pulls mussels from the reef. Although otters can feed on a variety of prey, many tend to specialize in one or two items and will often revisit the same foraging areas over and over. In the case of mussels, it's advantageous to revisit the same cluster because once they break through to the rock it becomes easier to peel off mussels on the edge.

They rely on it to keep warm, even in the freezing seas of Alaska, but it requires constant grooming.

,,,,,,"Photo by Matthieu Paley @paleyphoto | Like many of my colleagues, I get often asked, “How do you become a National Geographic photographer?” My answer is often that you don’t “want"" to be a National Geographic photographer; you just want to be a photographer who pursues a story like your life depends on it. That story must keep you up at night and make your heart beat faster. If you pursue it and work your craft, good things will invariably come. But it takes time—years. It’s not always easy, and aspiring photographers can be too impatient.

This photograph is from a story I worked on and off for more than 15 years, in Afghanistan’s Wakhan Corridor. It had turned into an obsession, requiring multiple expeditions in every season, learning the language and the landscape, and dealing with stress and joy. The image was taken in 2017 in a high pasture in the Pamir mountains, reachable after a two-week-long expedition. Sidol (at left), Jumagul (center), and Assan Khan were returning on their yaks after monitoring the growth of grasses at lower elevations. Herds would be kept off that pasture so the grasses could be harvested, dried, and used by the Wakhi people for animal fodder in the winter months. I was talking on the satellite phone with my wife on a hill when I saw these beasts climbing up toward me. I had to hang up … and was forgiven!

The park is Africa’s most biodiverse protected area, home to over a thousand mammal, bird, reptile, and amphibian species as well as 1/3 of the world’s endangered mountain gorillas. Virunga is known as the park of fire and ice for its diverse habitats ranging from the Rwenzori peaks to savanna and volcanic plains. Despite its status, Virunga is constantly threatened by war, poaching and other illegal activities, and natural disasters. With the support of donors, the Virunga Foundation actively conserves the park, which spans over 3,000 square miles (7,800 sq km). Over 5 million people reside within a day’s walk of it, many living in extreme poverty and enduring more than 30 years of conflict. The fertile lands in and around Virunga are prime for agricultural exploitation. By preserving the land, many of the world’s poorest are forced to sacrifice opportunity. To tackle this social justice issue, with the support of the EU, Virunga National Park has founded an initiative to foster a locally-led ""green"" economy based on ecotourism, sustainable agriculture, and energy.

Fiddler crabs are known for their sexually dimorphic claws—the females have two small claws, whereas the male (seen here) has a small and a large one, used to both attract females and threaten other males. The crabs play a key role in the preservation of wetland habitat, aerating the substrate as they burrow in.

Doña Julia (above) also founded an organization of women who run a workshop (9th photo) for making chocolate that's sold across Ecuador.

Increased prosperity, better nutrition, and advances in medical science have contributed to a drastic increase in average life expectancy in recent decades.

Although there is no antiaging cure (yet), various scientific insights show that we ourselves can improve the quality of life in old age. While growing older comes naturally, reaching old age is not something to be taken for granted. I believe we should make the most of the life that is given to us. Whatever age I might reach, I hope I’ll sing like Maria Rosa, laugh like Grazia, splash around like Ries, cruise like Aldo, and play like Arnold—to name just a few of the individuals who have welcomed me into their lives during this assignment.

Abdul lost his father and all of his belongings when his village was burned to the ground.

Following an August 2017 attack by Muslim insurgents, Myanmar’s military began carrying out violent operations against the Rohingya in western Rakhine State, which resulted in grave crimes under international law, the torching of whole villages, and more than 700,000 of the Muslim ethnic minority group fleeing into Bangladesh. Despite condemnation from the international community, no real action has been done to secure justice and protection for the Rohingya.

,,,,,,"Photo by Charlie Hamilton James @chamiltonjames | Vultures feed on the carcass of a dead zebra on the plains of Tanzania's Serengeti National Park. The vulture's ugly appearance has purpose. The long, powerful necks of these Rüppell's griffon vultures are almost featherless—they have to reach into some pretty horrible places to feed and feathers would be a nuisance. Their bills are curved for tearing flesh and their tongues have backward-facing serrations to grip flesh and bring it into the mouth. Their personalities often confirm their grim demeanor; they're highly aggressive and make a disturbing rasping hiss. But when they're in the air, with wings spread to eight or so feet, they're as perfect a flier as any bird. In fact, the Rüppell's vulture holds the title of highest flying bird after one was once recorded at 37,000 feet (11,000 meters).

I captured this shot with a remote-triggered camera placed inside the carcass.

,,,,,,"Photo by @sofia_jaramillo5 | Judith Kasiama, who also goes by Juju Milay, poses for a portrait during Roam Fest in Sedona, Arizona, a mountain biking event series for women riders. The portrait is part of an ongoing project I call Women Who Roam, which highlights women of color and those from the LGBTQ+ community who are changing the face of the cycling industry. Kasiama is the founder of @colourthetrails, a collective that advocates for inclusivity in the outdoors.

“Biking is the freedom of mobility without barriers,"" she says. ""Biking is an opportunity to connect with other people. It’s a sense of community, it’s access to transportation, and above all, for me, it brings a lot of joy and childlike wonder.”

Based in Vancouver, Canada, Kasiama noticed barriers to mountain biking when she first began riding. She felt like the marketing by the bike industry promoted only the gnarliest, fastest, and most extreme riding, not the experiences of everyday riders. She also didn’t find anyone who looked like her in the brands’ marketing materials, which ran counter to her experience.

Through her work, Kasiama is helping adults and kids alike break down the barriers to access in the outdoors. “I know we have a long way to go, but for me, I just want more little Black girls doing stuff in the outdoors. To see someone who looks like them in these spaces and hopefully they can have the courage and feel supported in mountain biking or mountaineering or whatever it is.”

Today, with only 20% of the state accessible by road, nearly all of Alaska is highly dependent on aviation, both for essential transport between remote communities and to access remote wilderness areas. For many pilots, flying is simply a way of life: a way to connect to the landscape and to each other.

,,,,,,"Photos by @luisadorr | Polleras are symbols of cultural identity in Bolivia’s countryside. But the voluminous, traditional skirts worn by Indigenous Aymara and Quechua women have a complex history. Dating to the Spanish conquest in the 16th century, they were imposed by colonial rulers to reflect a style worn in Spain. The skirts eventually were adopted as part of Andean attire, most commonly associated with “cholitas”—Indigenous women from the highlands. Today the skirts, a reminder of rural oppression, are being fashioned as a potent symbol of cultural pride and empowerment by members of ImillaSkate, an all-women skateboarding troupe based in Cochabamba.

Since seizing control of the country in August 2021, the Taliban also has limited their freedom by implementing new laws and restrictions: Women in Afghanistan are forbidden to travel more than 48 miles outside their home without a “mahram,” or a male relative or guardian.

📸 @tamaramerino_photography | An ice climber ascends one of the dozens of glaciers in the remote, wind-whipped terrain of Chilean Patagonia. With its ice-carved peaks and fjords, southern Chile remains one of the wildest places on Earth.

📸 @christianziegler | A hummingbird gathers nectar from a cactus flower near Hermosillo, Mexico. In Aztec mythology, the bird represents the sun god Huitzilopochtli, conceived by his mother after she clutched a ball of hummingbird feathers that fell from the sky to her chest.

📸 @aitorlaraphoto | Alba Heredia, a dancer from Granada, Spain, performs at Tablao Flamenco la Carmela in Madrid. Originating in Andalusia about a thousand years ago, flamenco has evolved into a semi-improvised art form of percussive footwork, plaintive singing, and flurries of acoustic guitar.

📸 @putu_sayoga | After a two-year pandemic pause, the Bali Kite Festival returned in August. Hundreds of colorful, fluttering designs, such as this janggan (dragon kite), filled the sky above Mertasari Beach in Bali, Indonesia.

📸 Víctor Zea @victorz3a | In the Peruvian Andes, the ruins of the ancient Inca city of Choquequirao, a cousin to higher profile Machu Picchu, can be reached only by foot or mule. A proposed cable car could make the site more accessible to travelers.

📸 Corey Arnold @arni_coraldo | A large black bear leaves its den under a vacant home in South Lake Tahoe, California. As bear populations grow and humans expand into formerly undeveloped areas, more of the bruins have been learning to live alongside people—though ultimately city life is not good for these bears.

📸 Karine Aigner @kaigner | Before the coronavirus pandemic, people came to trade, sell, or watch birds at places like this in Havana, where onlookers gathered to watch a songbird take seeds from a handler’s tongue. The demand sparked by these competitions puts wild birds at risk from illegal collectors.

📸 Oliver Meckes and Nicole Ottawa @eyeofscience | Fungal filaments frame a spiky-bodied rotifer, a microscopic animal common in freshwater ecosystems. In soil sampled from Germany’s Black Forest, rotifers propel themselves through the thin films of water that surround plant parts and dirt particles, eating organic debris along the way. This image was taken with a scanning electron microscope, which uses electrons instead of light to capture fine details.

📸 @jasperdoest | A young forest elephant trots along with its parents in Gabon’s Lopé National Park, along one of many paths that generations of the animals have cut through the fruit-rich rainforest.

📸 Jennifer Hayes @jenniferhayesig | After battling to defend the eggs in its nest, an exhausted titan triggerfish lies down in a last attempt to save its young from being eaten by moon wrasses near Anilao, in the northern Philippines.

📸 @sergiomarijuan | A young lynx is photographed by camera trap at an abandoned farm. In 2002 fewer than a hundred of these animals survived in the wild. Since then, the population has grown tenfold, with at least 1,100 animals scattered across Spain and Portugal.

In soil sampled from Germany’s Black Forest, rotifers propel themselves through the thin films of water that surround plant parts and dirt particles, eating organic debris along the way. This image was taken with a scanning electron microscope, which uses electrons instead of light to capture fine details.

This year, the Seattle area recorded the worst city air quality in the world on October 19; air quality consistently deteriorated throughout the summer and fall because of smoke from wildfires—and the problem is getting worse. From 2009-2014, Washington residents were exposed to an average of 22 smoky days per year. From 2016-2020, residents were exposed to an annual average of 34. Climate change increases the wildfire season length, frequency, and burn area. Among the many impacts, it's reducing the ability of adventurers to safely recreate outdoors.

With dramatic peaks, verdant forests, and a swath of ice larger than anywhere but Greenland and Antarctica, it offers travelers one of the last wild frontiers.

About 88% of the country's glaciers can be found in the Northern Patagonian Ice Field. It's one of the world's critical water reserves, and the effects of climate change are visible and dramatic here. The Exploradores Glacier is receding an average of 0.7-0.8 meters (2.2.-2.6 ft) each year. Part of the ice tongue is covered by moraine, an accumulation of debris that comes with glacial movement.

Almost all Argentines grew up linked to fútbol in one way or another, and Lionel Messi is a national idol who had to overcome several battles to finally win the cup. In a very critical moment for my country—amid great environmental, social, and economic crises—this triumph means the possibility of at last celebrating something united.

It took 15 months for Winter to capture an image of P-22 under the Hollywood sign, using a camera trap. The photograph turned the cat into a celebrity and raised awareness of the plight of urban wildlife. P-22 also became an ambassador for all cougars and other creatures hemmed within scraps of disconnected habitat, cut off by massive freeways. Winter’s photographs ultimately helped create the $87 million Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing, the largest in the world, which broke ground in April.

Wildlife biologists captured P-22 last week for medical evaluation after reports of erratic behavior and a collision with a car. The 12-year-old cat had suffered from various age-related conditions, but the accident sealed his fate. He couldn’t be moved to a sanctuary because of his injuries. The animal’s legacy will live on, thanks to the nonprofit Save L.A.

,,,,,,"Photo by @stephenwilkes | A Day to Night image of J Bar L Ranch in Melville, Montana, from the September cover story on America's wild lands.

Located near Yellowstone National Park, the ranch aims to raise cattle while also conserving habitat for pronghorn, moose, trumpeter swans, and sage grouse, to name a few. Fences have been modified to allow wildlife to cross the ranch. Herds are bunched and moved frequently to mimic buffalo, whose tread shaped these grasslands. The bulls in this scene—assembled from 60 photos—graze before mountains known as the Crazies, as time passes from daybreak to sunset to starlit night.

I was deeply impressed by the ranch hands. They’re the real deal. Their whole being, their whole life, is connected to this land.

,,,,,,"Photo by @stephenwilkes | A Day to Night image of J Bar L Ranch in Melville, Montana, from the September cover story on America's wild lands.

Located near Yellowstone National Park, the ranch aims to raise cattle while also conserving habitat for pronghorn, moose, trumpeter swans, and sage grouse, to name a few. Fences have been modified to allow wildlife to cross the ranch. Herds are bunched and moved frequently to mimic buffalo, whose tread shaped these grasslands. The bulls in this scene—assembled from 60 photos—graze before mountains known as the Crazies, as time passes from daybreak to sunset to starlit night.

I was deeply impressed by the ranch hands. They’re the real deal. Their whole being, their whole life, is connected to this land.

,,,,,,"Photo by @sofia_jaramillo5 | Alyssa Gonzalez stands for a portrait during a women’s mountain biking festival in Sedona, Arizona. It's part of a series I call Women Who Roam, for the @thisisroam attendees endeavoring to change the face of the cycling industry.

Gonzalez is a professional cyclist and works as a DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion) consultant. She's an advocate for gender diversity in cycling and a community builder focused on creating opportunities and experiences for women of color and others in marginalized communities.

“As a queer woman of color, the act of just showing up on the trails on my bike is radical,"" she says, ""and I try to pass that message on and the joy of cycling to all folks I meet.""

""Biking has become a huge part of my life. It’s how I move my body, exercise, and process. It’s been the main way that I’ve found more diverse and inclusive communities to be part of. I’ve learned a lot about what I can do with my body and mind while on a bike, and it’s transferred to my everyday life. The bike has made me stronger, more confident, social, aware, and gritty.”

I asked what changes she’d like to see in the outdoor community. “More of an attitude that everyone has a space in the outdoors and in nature, and less of a gatekeeping mentality,"" she says. ""I would love to see more respect and acknowledgment for Indigenous folks and their land. Indigenous sovereignty and the land back movement are so important for our climate, the outdoors, and the communities of Native folks in this country and beyond.”

,,,,,,"Photos by @amivitale | Ever since the last male northern white rhino died in 2018 (and the two remaining females are too old to reproduce), scientists have been working on in vitro solutions in an attempt to resurrect the functionally extinct species.

Now there's breaking news: The @biorescue_project has produced primordial germ cells from northern white rhino stem cells—a world’s first for large mammals. Primordial germ cells are embryonic precursors of sperm and eggs that pass on genetic and epigenetic information from one generation to the next. This paves the way to produce functional gametes (eggs and sperm) from the preserved tissue of other northern white rhinos. If successful, this would boost the availability and genetic diversity of embryos and become a cornerstone for saving the northern white rhinoceros.

The @biorescue_project has already successfully created 22 embryos from oocytes harvested from Fatu, as one of the rhinos is named. This latest development is one more huge step in saving this species—and potentially many others—from certain extinction.

I’m not a wildlife photographer. I don’t have the patience to sit for hours, days, or months in order to get that shot. What’s brought me here is the birth of this cub and the significance of it in terms of human-wildlife coexistence. I’m here to bear witness to the reinstatement of wildlife and ecosystems that man’s very presence has previously destroyed. A powerful symbol of the restoration and regeneration of the country’s natural landscape is the Arabian leopard. Amal (“hope”) is one of two cubs born recently at the breeding center here in Taif. The goal is that, in the not too distant future, she will contribute to the rewilding of this landscape when these truly majestic cats are reintroduced back into their rightful position as apex predators. A lot of work will need to be done before that happens, but what we see here is an enormously bright light by which progress can be illuminated.

The act prohibits both owning lions, tigers, and other big cats (including hybrids such as ligers) as pets and public contact with them, including petting and taking selfies with cubs. Commercial breeding that has supplied cubs to lucrative “tiger playtime” tourist attractions at roadside zoos must now come to an end.

@sharon.guynup and I spent two years investigating this wildlife trade for National Geographic. Our reporting revealed that most cubs in the U.S.—where captive tigers outnumber those in the wild—were born in ""tiger mills,"" pulled from their mothers at birth. Females churn out back-to-back litters, compared with one every two years in the wild. Many cubs were ill-fed, inbred, and in poor health with no vet care. Unknown numbers died. Some were sold and illegally trafficked to other states even before their eyes opened. At three months, cubs reach their “expiration date”—too big and dangerous to pet—and are discarded. The crisis was a result of lax USDA oversight and no federal regulations.

This law not only protects captive cats but also the public and first responders from these large, dangerous predators.

But it doesn't end with U.S. policy. There is more to be done on tiger ""farming"" in China, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam, where cats are raised for the high-end trade in tiger skin decor and tiger bone ""wine.""

They hope it could be a solution for arid coastal countries, which must invest in a costly process of desalinating water for crops. These plastic domes—called Nemo's Garden—shelter biospheres containing plant seeds, fans, hydroponic equipment, and a bit of starter water—condensation takes care of the rest.

Each of the five biospheres is an independent environment. Light is provided by the penetrating sun, but when needed a ring (center) gives an extra boost. A small fan keeps air circulating. The garden is monitored remotely by a crew on shore.

In August 2021, when the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, a way of life with freedoms and civil rights that many Afghans cherished for two decades was turned upside down. The Taliban cracked down, arresting, beating, and kidnapping women rights’ activists. The woman pictured here says she has received death threats and was beaten by the Taliban with the butt of an AK-47 rifle for participating in public protests. She has since fled the country, hoping to immigrate to the U.S. or Europe, but struggles to find visa opportunities for herself and her family, who remain in Afghanistan.

African painted dogs are very social, and packs frequently share food and assist ill or weak family members. Intricate social interactions are common, and the dogs communicate by touch, vocalizations, and actions. Painted dogs are endangered and faced with shrinking room to roam in their African home. They are also quite susceptible to diseases spread by domestic animals.

With its unique location on the world’s largest steppe, Astana is susceptible to extreme weather, sometimes resulting in striking views.

Since 1997, this once small town has risen from a forsaken landscape and post-Soviet rubble, transforming into a futuristic city. After replacing Almaty as the country's capital, Astana grew from having 320,000 inhabitants to over 1.2 million.

Before restoring the capital's name to Astana earlier this year, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev had renamed it Nursultan to honor outgoing Nursultan Nazarbayev, who announced his resignation in 2019 after serving as the first and only president of modern Kazakhstan for almost 30 years. Since its founding as a Russian military outpost in 1824, Astana has undergone several naming iterations—in fact, the city holds the Guinness World Record for most name changes.

There is something unusual about Drunken Forest, as you can see. In certain parts of the cave, the stalagmites lean. On first impression, they look like they were formed at an angle, but that's not the case. It's thought that an earthquake many years ago tilted the stalagmites. Here, researchers Gina Moseley from the University of Innsbruck and Nele Meckler of Bergen University take a drip-water sample from a stalagmite.",57.469 Me gusta,2022-11-23T17:00:11.000Z,https://scontent-mad2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/316668227_667480844816614_6144786202012612435_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-mad2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=i0uOCFPtc40AX_JrUeM&edm=ABmJApABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=Mjk3Nzk3OTE4ODE4MDQ0NzM3OA%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfBuSdfch5qU07D5wHHJ6PNTtl0Xp1pMTLsbVyrjKgsAuA&oe=64160E0D&_nc_sid=6136e7,imagenpreubaH433-1.jpg,"Photo by National Geographic on November 23, 2022.",433

In the fall, millions of salmon return to the lake to spawn at the Chilko River's mouth, creating an incredibly rich food source for the bears.

At the German Environmental Specimen Bank, Dominik Lermen stands among cryo-storage tanks that hold thousands of vials of blood and urine. Lerman leads the team that collects samples from volunteers every year and stores them here on behalf of the German Environment Agency.

It's part of a federal ministry's effort to “to systematically monitor and analyze human exposure to chemicals like lead, mercury, plasticizers, and others,” Lermen says. The project traces which substances have accumulated at potentially dangerous levels, and considers whether bans and regulations of some of those substances have been effective.

Its population is now stable in Ecuador, but in the past, it had disappeared from the wild and was reintroduced with animals from Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. The vicuña belongs to the same genus as the alpaca, but the former is still wild while the latter has been domesticated.

,,,,,,"Photo by @iantehphotography | The trip was a grand adventure: a rickety train ride from Hanoi toward Lao Cai, near the China border, then a drive up into the picturesque paddy fields in Sapa, where I met up with farmers for a final trek into cardamom plantations grown under the rainforest canopy. It was also a lesson in Vietnam’s recent environmental history: Black cardamom, thao qua, an essential spice in pho and other Vietnamese dishes, was first planted in the Hoang Lien Mountains in the 1990s as a replacement for opium, a banned crop that once helped prop up Indochina’s colonial economy. The area, known as Hoang Lien National Park, is a symbol of postwar Vietnam’s efforts to protect plant biodiversity. Hence this puzzle: How could a forest simultaneously be a haven for conservation and agricultural cash crop?

Over a few days of camping in the forest, we observe farmers harvesting cherry red pods of raw cardamom with machetes beside a stream. In the afternoons, they smoked the refrigerator-size piles under fire till they turned coffee brown, significantly reducing their weight for the hike back. On our return, we stop at this spot revealing a set of lush green peaks before we dip down into thick vegetation for the remainder of our walk home.

,,,,,,"Photos by Corey Arnold @arni_coraldo | Learning to camera-trap wildlife, especially in urban settings, takes a lot of practice and luck. One of the toughest variables is predicting where the animal you are trying to photograph will travel within a frame, and this fence hole in Chicago narrowed my options for success. A parade of animals passed through here every night to access an underpass beneath a busy highway that connected two large green spaces.

The base offered the team a starting point to access nearby caves, where the scientists had several sampling sites. At the end of each long and tiring day, it was an amazing feeling to relax while gazing up at the white cliffs of limestone—which reveal several cave entrances.

(2) Women displaced by drought seek help at the Gabo Gabo camp about 15 miles (24 km) from Jijiga, the capital city of the Somali region in Ethiopia, in May 2021. (3) Twenty-eight-year-old Şahan Omer Jibrin, a mother of eight children, has been living in a camp for three months. She had to flee her home in Ula Ula, Ethiopia, to seek aid because of the drought. (4) A grave humanitarian crisis is unfolding in Ethiopia, which is struggling with a vicious civil war in the north and devastating climate-change effects in the south. Prolonged drought has wiped out livestock, driven displacement, and altered families’ ability to make a living.

You might expect the mechanical behemoth to surge to life with a trembling roar, or at least a deep, low growl, but for the first half minute, this Goss Suburban newspaper press is silent. Soon the gears swell into a loud zipping that alerts the staff, standing in anticipation, to the first copy’s emergence.

It is a process that requires a great deal of care.

Spending time with the staff at the Welch News, it becomes clear that devotion to care begins at the printing press before bleeding out like runaway ink into the community it serves, finally coming to rest contentedly in the homes of its roughly 3,000 subscribers in West Virginia’s Appalachia.

Studying these iconic giants also allows us to tap into knowledge that may one day help our own species.

This coyote is letting out a defensive warning—a howl toward the presence of a pre-dawn dog walker nearby. Coyotes often feast on rodents and other natural foods found in parks, empty lots, and overgrown green spaces. But there are conflicting opinions about whether coyotes should be allowed to populate dense urban spaces. Pets such as cats and small dogs have increasingly been targeted as the coyotes expand across the San Francisco Bay Area.

The Maasai people are an Indigenous ethnic group in southern Kenya and northern Tanzania who maintain their way of life, despite government programs encouraging them to give up their seminomadic lifestyle. The Maasai’s traditional survival skills—such as the ability to produce food in dry, arid lands—offer strategies for adapting to environments altered by climate change, an Oxford study has found.

She feared for the safety of her friends and family. She knew that the Taliban regime not only forbade Afghan women from participating in sports but also historically had targeted Afghanistan’s Hazara ethnic minority population.

Zahra was introduced to long-distance running in Afghanistan, where she joined Free to Run, a nonprofit that empowers women and girls around the world through sport. She went on to finish three marathons there and competed in a Half Ironman in Dubai in February 2020.

Last year, Zahra ran the 50th TCS New York City Marathon in 4:59:41. It was her personal best marathon time by 10 minutes. She finished 6,826th of 11,350 women. She was the only runner from Afghanistan.

“Whenever I feel like I can’t run any farther, I think about all the girls and women who cannot run in Afghanistan, who cannot get an education, who cannot go to work,” says Zahra, who is Hazara. “Their problems are bigger than mine, and when I remember them, it motivates me to keep going, to do whatever I can for Afghan women and my family. The women in Afghanistan are the main source of my inspiration. I keep praying for them, and it is for them that I run.”

He lives with nine other bonobos at the Fort Worth Zoo, and they get along much like their wild contemporaries do, resolving conflict with love and affection over hostility. The noted primatologist Frans de Waal believes that bonobos may even have more empathy for one another than humans are capable of. ⁣⁣

I capture my subjects in the magical atmosphere of a place connected to their work—and in this case, their dreams.

Katie Sipes, a postdoctoral researcher, dressed as her favorite movie character, Frozen's Elsa. She took this costume with her on a permafrost expedition because she had dreamed of somehow finding an occasion to wear it in the far reaches of Norway, which inspired the film's fictional kingdom. With this portrait, she now had the chance. Sipes identifies with the character's call to forge her own path, and the idea, she says, that “strong females don’t need a prince.”

Her mission is to study Arctic ecosystems and the organisms that rely on them, she says, ""allowing humans to better understand the magnitude and incredible diversity that lives on our own planet."" And knowing this extreme environment better might prime us to better understand other planets, she adds. She's drawn by a sense of urgency: ""This endangered ecosystem is on the cusp of being lost forever. The purity of the Arctic amplifies the desire to preserve and study all of its hidden secrets that might change our world.” Follow me @estherhorvath for more polar science stories.",69.205 Me gusta,2022-10-31T16:00:13.000Z,https://scontent-mad1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/313293106_1050335848971878_2272045214374907483_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-mad1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=l1TldwvWTmMAX_MjAWS&edm=ABmJApABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=Mjk2MTI3OTE3MDk4MzE2NzcxMQ%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfBhsR0G5ZnT15T7pYwHZiQd4RfGiUJ7vq5Covbx3PHmUA&oe=64173F36&_nc_sid=6136e7,imagenpreubaH508-1.jpg,"Photo by National Geographic on October 31, 2022.",508

What remains of suitable lion habitat is under threat from human encroachment, climate change, and degradation. Without wilderness, lion numbers—and the numbers of so many other species—will continue to diminish. A new assessment by the World Wildlife Fund warns that across the globe, populations of vertebrates (mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish) have declined by 69% on average since 1970, with habitat destruction as a leading cause in all regions. To stem and reverse these losses, we need to focus our will and energy on preserving and protecting habitats—in short, we need to make room for wildlife.
